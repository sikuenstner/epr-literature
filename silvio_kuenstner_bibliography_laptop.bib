It is pointed out that the shape function, normalized by integration over the magnetic field, must be multiplied by a factor which in the S = 12 case equals the inverse of the g-value. This factor seemingly has been omitted in previous calculations of intensities and shapes. As a consequence, the integrated intensity of an isotropic line is proportional to its g-value and not to g2. The total intensity of a powder spectrum is calculated, and examples of simulations of such spectra are given. A method for the determination of total intensities from the area under an “absorption” peak in a first derivative powder spectrum is also given.},

Various methods have been proposed to address this issue, among which spin trapping with cyclic nitrones coupled to EPR spectroscopy, the gold standard for detection of radicals. This technique is based on the nucleophilic addition of superoxide to a diamagnetic cyclic nitrone, referred to as the spin trap, and the formation of a spin adduct, i.e. a persistent radical with a characteristic EPR spectrum. The first application of spin trapping to living cells dates back 1979. Since then, considerable improvements of the method have been achieved both in the structures of the spin traps, the EPR methodology, and the design of the experiments including appropriate controls. Here, we will concentrate on technical aspects of the spin trapping/EPR technique, delineating recent breakthroughs, inherent limitations, and potential artifacts.},

  abstract = {Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) play crucial roles in triggering, mediating and regulating physiological and pathophysiological signal transduction pathways within the cell. Within the cell, ROS efflux is firmly controlled both spatially and temporally, making the study of ROS dynamics a challenging task. Different approaches have been developed for ROS assessment; however, many of these assays are not capable of direct identification or determination of subcellular localization of different ROS. Here we highlight electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy as a powerful technique that is uniquely capable of addressing questions on ROS dynamics in different biological specimens and cellular compartments. Due to their critical importance in muscle functions and dysfunction, we discuss in some detail spin trapping of various ROS and focus on EPR detection of nitric oxide before highlighting how EPR can be utilized to probe biophysical characteristics of the environment surrounding a given stable radical. Despite the demonstrated ability of EPR spectroscopy to provide unique information on the identity, quantity, dynamics and environment of radical species, its applications in the field of muscle physiology, fatiguing and ageing are disproportionately infrequent. While reviewing the limited examples of successful EPR applications in muscle biology we conclude that the field would greatly benefit from more studies exploring ROS sources and kinetics by spin trapping, protein dynamics by site-directed spin labelling, and membrane dynamics and global redox changes by spin probing EPR approaches.},

The self-consistent field approximation, in which the state of the free ion is described by a single electronic configuration, is found to be inadequate, and it is found necessary to consider admixtures, through configurational coupling, of configurations in which there are unpaired s-electrons, as these contribute significantly to the hyperfine splitting.

However, imaging human-sized objects at such high field strength and associated precession frequencies is limited due to the technical challenges associated with the wavelength effect, which substantially disturb the transmit field uniformity over the human body when conventional coils are used. Here we report a novel passive inductively-coupled radiofrequency resonator array design with a simple structure that works in conjunction with conventional coils and requires only to be tuned to the scanner’s operating frequency. We show that inductive-coupling between the resonator array and the coil improves the transmit efficiency and signal sensitivity in the targeted region. The simple structure, flexibility, and cost-efficiency make the proposed array design an attractive approach for altering the transmit field distribution specially at high field systems, where the wavelength is comparable with the tissue size.},

Among them redox flow batteries (RFBs) exhibit very high potential for several reasons, including power/energy independent sizing, high efficiency, room temperature operation, and extremely long charge/discharge cycle life. RFB technologies make use of different metal ion couples as reacting species. The best-researched and already commercially exploited types are all-vanadium redox batteries, but several research programs on other redox couples are underway in a number of countries.

The basis of the cell concept is electron-beam-crystallization of an amorphous or nanocrystalline silicon layer deposited onto a SiC:B layer. The SiC:B layer covers a commercially well available glass substrate, serving as diffusion barrier, contact layer and dopand source. For silicon absorber deposition a low pressure chemical vapour deposition was used. The successively applied e-beam crystallization process creates poly-silicon layers with grain sizes up to 1 × 10 mm2 with low defect densities. The high electronic quality of the absorber is reflected in open circuit voltages as high as 545 mV, which are realized making use of the well-developed a-Si:H hetero-emitter technology.

  abstract = {Techniques based on spin resonance effects are amongst the most powerful analytical methods in both modern chemistry and medicine. Recent years have seen a trend toward scaled-down detection coils, exploiting the fact that a reduction of the detector size in principle increases the spin sensitivity of the detector [74, 144]. This improved spin sensitivity opens up a new range of applications: In NMR and ESR spectroscopy, the scaled-down detector size allows for the study of mass-limited samples with volumes in the microliter and nanoliter range [16, 111, 157, 162] while in NMR and ESR microscopy applications miniaturized detectors are used to perform high spatial resolution imaging on small objects [6, 10, 122, 136, 139, 156]. Here, the improved spin sensitivity ensures reasonable acquisition times even for spatial resolutions in the micrometer range. In this thesis, fully-integrated and hybrid CMOS detectors for both NMR and ESR applications with varying degrees of integration have been realized and tested. Here, the last generation of fully-integrated receivers, realized in a 0.13 μm CMOS technology, co- integrates a detection coil with a diameter of 345 μm together with a complete quadrature receiver consisting of a low noise amplifier (LNA), a quadrature downconversion mixer and a baseband amplification stage. Thanks to the use of the modern integrated circuit technologies with its scaled-down feature sizes, the receiver is designed to fit entirely underneath the detection coil, allowing for the design of densely packed arrays of receivers. The best measured time-domain spin sensitivity of the fully-integrated designs is 9 ×1013 spins/ Hz at an operating frequency of 300 MHz corresponding to 1H NMR in a 7 T magnet. First prototypes of densely-packed arrays in an older 0.35μm CMOS technology have been designed and tested. In these designs, the size of the detection coils is (520 μm)2 . Due to the larger size of the detection coil and the older technology, the measured time-domain spin sensitivities are about an order of magnitude worse compared to the designs realized in the 0.13 μm technology. Apart from the sensitivity tests a first model of the inter-channel crosstalk has been developed and verified which should allow for software-based cross-talk reduction in future versions of arrays. In addition to the circuit realizations, a complete modeling of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance for fully-integrated radio frequency (RF) frontends for NMR applications has been developed, which includes both the intrinsic coil SNR and the additional contribution from the LNA. The model allows for the selection of an optimum size of the detection coil as well as the choice of the optimum technology and topology of the entire RF frontend for a given application. Apart from the fully-integrated receivers, small arrays of hybrid detection systems consisting of external, high-quality solenoidal microcoils and custom-designed CMOS receivers have been designed and tested. Here, the best measured spin sensitivity is about 5×1013 spins/ Hz. In a very specific application for fully-integrated CMOS receivers for NMR, a prototype of an NMR-based positioning sensor for magnetic resonance based surgical guidance has been developed. The microsystem achieves a three-dimensional isotropic spatial resolution of 150 μm in a measuring time of 100 ms. Besides the work on integrated NMR detectors, a fully-integrated frequency-sensitive ESR sensor has been realized. The chip consists of an on-chip LC tank oscillator with a diameter of the on-chip inductor of about 100 μm, a frequency division module and an output buffer. It works in the K-band at an operating frequency of about 27 GHz and achieves a spin sensitivity of about 1.9 × 108 spins/ Hz, which is the best spin sensitivity achieved using inductive detection methods reported up to now. In addition to the circuit design and testing of the ESR system, a complete model of the SNR performance of frequency-sensitive ESR detectors has been developed and verified against measurements. Here, the noise modeling is of particular interest, because it applies a special case of Bogoliubov’s asymptotic method to an LC tank oscillator, resulting in analytical expressions for the phase and frequency noise behavior of such systems which give accurate predictions, agreeing within a few dB with measured results, but furthermore provide the designer with useful insights into design critical tradeoffs.},

This paper presents the first applications of a NR resonator in W-band pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. It consists of a cylindrical cavity having a lateral aperture that represents about 35\% of its total height. Electron-spin-echo measurements performed on different samples show that the signal-to-noise ratio and the optimal pulse length obtained with the proposed device are comparable to those obtained with the closed cavity used in the commercial W-band spectrometer, at both cryogenic and room temperature. Similar results have been obtained for paramagnetic species optically activated by means of an optical fiber inserted in the aperture of the resonator. The insertion losses estimated for the probe employed with the NR resonator are higher than those of the commercial probe, hence, demonstrating that the proposed cavity holds the promise of improved resonator performance.},

  abstract = {The field of electron spin resonance (ESR) is in constant need of improving its capabilities. Among other things, this means having better resonators to reach improved spin sensitivity and enable larger microwave-power-to-microwave-magnetic-field conversion factors. Surface micro-resonators, made of small metallic patches on a dielectric substrate, provide very good absolute spin sensitivity and high conversion factors due to their very small mode volume. However, such resonators suffer from relatively low spin concentration sensitivity and a low-quality factor, a fact that offsets some of their significant potential advantages. The use of superconducting patches to replace the metallic layer seems a reasonable and straightforward solution to the quality factor issue, at least for measurements carried out at cryogenic temperatures. Nevertheless, superconducting materials, especially those that can operate at moderate cryogenic temperatures, are not easily incorporated into setups requiring high magnetic fields due to the electric current vortices generated in the latter’s surface. This makes the transition from normal conducting materials to superconductors highly nontrivial. Here we present the design, fabrication, and testing results of surface micro-resonators made of yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO), a superconducting material that operates also at high magnetic fields and makes it possible to pursue ESR at moderate cryogenic temperatures (up to\,∼\,80\,K). We show that with a unique experimental setup, these resonators can be made to operate well even at high fields of\,∼\,1.2\,T. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of current vortices on the ESR signal and the spins' coherence times. Finally, we provide a head-to-head comparison of YBCO vs copper resonators of the same dimensions, which clearly shows their pros and cons and directs us to future potential developments and improvements in this field.},

In a combined optical and electron paramagnetic resonance study, we show that the doping of rreP3HT in solution occurs by integer charge transfer, resulting in formation of P3HT radical cations (polarons) for all of the dopants considered here. Remarkably, despite the different chemical nature of the dopants and dopant–polymer interaction, the formed polarons exhibit essentially identical optical absorption spectra. The situation is very different for the doping of rraP3HT, where we observe formation of a charge-transfer complex with F4TCNQ and of a “localized” P3HT polaron on nonaggregated chains upon doping with BCF, while there is no indication of dopant-induced species in the case of Mo(tfd-CO2Me)3. We estimate the ionization efficiency of the respective dopants for the two polymers in solution and report the molar extinction coefficient spectra of the three different species. Finally, we observe increased spin delocalization in regioregular compared to regiorandom P3HT by electron nuclear double resonance, suggesting that the ability of the charge to delocalize on aggregates of planarized polymer backbones plays a significant role in determining the doping mechanism.},

  abstract = {One of the major sources of lost capacity in all-vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) is the undesired transport (usually called crossover) of water and vanadium ions through the ion-exchange membrane. In this work, an experimental assessment of the impact of ion-exchange membrane properties on vanadium ion crossover and capacity decay of VRFBs has been performed. Two types of cationic membranes (non-reinforced and reinforced) with three equivalent weights of 800, 950 and 1100 g·mol−1 were investigated via a series of in situ performance and capacity decay tests along with ex situ vanadium crossover measurement and membrane characterization. For non-reinforced membranes, increasing the equivalent weight (EW) from 950 to 1100 g·mol−1 decreases the V(IV) permeability by \textasciitilde 30\%, but increases the area-specific resistance (ASR) by \textasciitilde 16\%. This increase in ASR and decrease in V(IV) permeability was accompanied by increased through-plane membrane swelling. Comparing the non-reinforced with reinforced membranes, membrane reinforcement increases ASR, but V(IV) permeability decreases. It was also shown that there exists a monotonic correlation between the discharge capacity decay over long-term cycling and V(IV) permeability values. Thus, V(IV) permeability is considered a representative diagnostic for assessing the overall performance of a particular ion-exchange membrane with respect to capacity fade in a VRFB.},

  abstract = {The influence of dangling-bond defects and the position of the Fermi level on the charge carrier transport properties in undoped and phosphorous doped thin-film silicon with structure compositions all the way from highly crystalline to amorphous is investigated. The dangling-bond density is varied reproducibly over several orders of magnitude by electron bombardment and subsequent annealing. The defects are investigated by electron-spin-resonance and photoconductivity spectroscopies. Comparing intrinsic amorphous and microcrystalline silicon, it is found that the relationship between defect density and photoconductivity is different in both undoped materials, while a similar strong influence of the position of the Fermi level on photoconductivity via the charge carrier lifetime is found in the doped materials. The latter allows a quantitative determination of the value of the transport gap energy in microcrystalline silicon. The photoconductivity in intrinsic microcrystalline silicon is, on one hand, considerably less affected by the bombardment but, on the other hand, does not generally recover with annealing of the defects and is independent from the spin density which itself can be annealed back to the as-deposited level. For amorphous silicon and material prepared close to the crystalline growth regime, the results for nonequilibrium transport fit perfectly to a recombination model based on direct capture into neutral dangling bonds over a wide range of defect densities. For the heterogeneous microcrystalline silicon, this model fails completely. The application of photoconductivity spectroscopy in the constant photocurrent mode (CPM) is explored for the entire structure composition range over a wide variation in defect densities. For amorphous silicon previously reported linear correlation between the spin density and the subgap absorption is confirmed for defect densities below 1018 cm−3. Beyond this defect level, a sublinear relation is found i.e., not all spin-detected defects are also visible in the CPM spectra. Finally, the evaluation of CPM spectra in defect-rich microcrystalline silicon shows complete absence of any correlation between spin-detected defects and subband gap absorption determined from CPM: a result which casts considerable doubt on the usefulness of this technique for the determination of defect densities in microcrystalline silicon. The result can be related to the inhomogeneous structure of microcrystalline silicon with its consequences on transport and recombination processes.},

  abstract = {In the present work we investigated various charge transfer processes, as they appear in the versatile world of organic semiconductors by probing the spin states of the corresponding charge carrier species via electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. All studied material systems are carbon-based compounds, either belonging to the group of polymers, fullerenes, or single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWNTs).  In the first instance, we addressed the change of the open circuit voltage (Voc) with the fullerene blend stoichiometry in fullerene-based solar cells for organic photovoltaics (OPV). The voltage depends strongly on the energy separation between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the donor and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the acceptor. By exploiting the Gaussian distribution of the charge carriers in a two-level system, and thus also their spins in the EPR experiment, it could be shown that the LUMOs get closer by a few to a few hundred meV when going from pure fullerene materials to a fullerene mixture. The reason for this strong energetic effect is likely the formation of a fullerene alloy. Further, we investigated the chemical doping mechanism of SWNTs with a (6,5)-chirality and their behaviour under optical excitation.  In order to determine the unintentional (pre)-doping of SWNTs, EPR spectra of the raw material as well as after different purification steps were recorded. This facilitated the determination of nanotube defects and atmospheric p-doping as the causes of the measured EPR signals. In order to deliberately transfer additional charge carriers to the nanotubes, we added the redox-active substance AuCl3 where we determined an associated doping-yield of (1.5±0.2)\%. In addition, a statistical occupation model was developed which can be used to simulate the distribution of EPR active, i.e. unpaired and localised charge carriers on the nanotubes.  Finally, we investigated the charge transfer behaviour of (6,5)-SWNTs together with the polymer P3HT and the fullerene PC60BM after optical excitation.},

Comprehensive EPR measurements are reported of 4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-d16;1-15N-1-oxyl (perdeuterated 15N Tempone; 15pDT), in 70 wt \% aqueous glycerol as functions of concentration and temperature. The method, termed the relative broadening constant method (RBCM), is demonstrated by using the present results together with those in the literature that employed perdeuterated 14N Tempone (14pDT) under identical conditions. In principle, the separation of DD and HSE is dependent on the model of diffusion and molecular-kinetic parameters; however, within present day experimental uncertainties, the RBCM method turns out to be insensitive to the model. The earlier methods to separate DD and HSE by measuring the dispersion component introduced by the two interactions shows general agreement with the RBCM; however, there are discrepancies larger than estimated uncertainties due to random errors. Thus, further support is found for Salikhov’s recent theory of the effects of DD and HSE on EPR spectra (Appl. Magn. Reson. 2010, 38, 237); however, detailed confirmation is still lacking. The RBCM affords a possible approach to separate HSE and DD in spectra complicated by slow motion and/or overlap with other resonance lines, allowing the method to be used in situations more complicated than low-viscosity simple liquids.},

The well-known features are reconfirmed: (1) at low values of \$\$\textbackslash omega\_\{\textbackslash text\{ex\}\}\$\$where the lines broaden, shift toward the center of the spectrum, and change shape due to the introduction of a resonance of the form of a dispersion component; (2) at values of \$\$\textbackslash omega\_\{\textbackslash text\{ex\}\}\$\$comparable to \$\$A\_\{0\}\$\$, where the lines merge into one; and (3) at values much larger than \$\$A\_\{0\}\$\$, where the merged line narrows. It is found that each line of a spectrum may be decomposed into an admixture of a single absorption and a single dispersion component of Lorentzian shape. These two- or three-line absorption–dispersion admixtures, for 15N and 14N, respectively, retain their individual identities even after the spectrum has merged and has begun to narrow. For both isotopes, the average broadening and integrated intensities are equal to the predictions of perturbation theory although, in the case of 14N, the outer lines broaden faster than the central line and intensity moves from the outer lines to the central line. In fact, the outer line intensity becomes zero and then negative at higher values of \$\$\textbackslash omega\_\{\textbackslash text\{ex\}\}\$\$which is compensated by the central line becoming more intense than the overall integrated intensity. For both isotopes, the dispersion components and the line shifts depart from the perturbation predictions. The results are presented in terms of measurable quantities normalized to \$\$A\_\{0\}\$\$so that they may be applied to any two- or three-line spectrum.},

  abstract = {Some metalloproteins which contain [2f-2S] clusters give EPR spectra characterized by gav ≈ 1.91, which is significantly lower than the value gav ≈ 1.96 usually obtained for the ferredoxins. A similar lowering of gav is observed for some [2F-2S]+ thiolate synthetic compounds in glass-forming solvents, or in compounds where phenolates replace thiolates as terminal ligands. We show that a good correlation is observed for all the proteins and synthetic compounds characterized by gav ≈ 1.91, when the main components, g1, g2, g3, of the g̃ tensor are plotted as a function of (g2 − g3). This correlation supports the existence of a new class of [2F-2S]+ clusters. A ligand-field analysis shows that the difference between the two kinds of EPR spectrum reflect essentially two different structures for the ferrous site. This conclucsion is in agreement with the spectroscopic studies performed on the Rieske protein from Thermus thermophilus.},

The nitroxides included 6-member, unsaturated 5-member, or saturated 5-member rings, most of which were isotopically labeled. The spectra are near the fast tumbling limit with T1∼T2 in the range of 0.50–1.1μs at ambient temperature. Both spin–lattice relaxation T1 and spin–spin relaxation T2 are longer for 15N- than for 14N-nitroxides. The dominant contributions to T1 are modulation of nitrogen hyperfine anisotropy and spin rotation. Dependence of T1 on nitrogen nuclear spin state mI was observed for both 14N and 15N. Unresolved hydrogen/deuterium hyperfine couplings dominate overall line widths. Lineshapes were simulated by including all nuclear hyperfine couplings and spin packet line widths that agreed with values obtained by electron spin echo. Line widths and relaxation times are predicted to be about the same at 250MHz as at X-band.},

Stable free radicals, such as 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO), in a suitable solvent (e.g., benzene) can be used as a quantification standard. Free radicals found in samples can be shorter lived than radicals in prepared standards and require stabilizing spin-trapping agents such as N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN) in an appropriate solvent (e.g., benzene). Analysis in our laboratory showed that free radicals from spin-trapped samples quantified against a standard of TEMPO in benzene displayed large differences among identical samples measured on either a Micro-Now 8300, Micro-Now 8400, or Bruker EMX EPR instrument. The Bruker instrument reported that the typical TEMPO in benzene standard had a Q-factor of ∼4400 while the Q-factor of our PBN-containing samples was ∼2500. (The Q-factor is inversely proportional to the amount of dissipated microwave energy in an EPR cavity.) By placing the TEMPO standard in a PBN/benzene solvent matrix we were able to match the Q-factor of our standards and samples, resulting in each of the three EPR instruments giving the same quantified free radical yields for the samples. This result points out the importance of matching the Q-factor between samples and standards for any quantitative EPR measurement.},

Following this, a theoretical description of the factors affecting the sensitivity and resolution in induction detection ESR is provided. Based on the theory, new approaches to substantially improve ESR capabilities, both at room temperature and at low cryogenic temperatures, are discussed. Representative results of experiments conducted at room temperature and at frequencies of 10–16 GHz show that with test samples, a sensitivity of \textasciitilde 107 electron spins and a resolution of \textasciitilde 3 microns are currently available. The results confirm the validity of the theoretical approach and confirm the value of striving for even higher frequencies and lower temperatures, in order to further improve the performance Finally, some of the current and potential applications of ESR microscopy and nanoscopy (involving imaging with a resolution of \textasciitilde 100 nm or better) are presented.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance is a very powerful methodology that has been employed successfully in many applications for about 70years now, resulting in a wealth of scientific, technological, and diagnostic data. Despite its many advantages, one major drawback of magnetic resonance is its relatively poor sensitivity and, as a consequence, its bad spatial resolution when examining heterogeneous samples. Contemporary science and technology often make use of very small amounts of material and examine heterogeneity on a very small length scale, both of which are well beyond the current capabilities of conventional magnetic resonance. It is therefore very important to significantly improve both the sensitivity and the spatial resolution of magnetic resonance techniques. The quest for higher sensitivity led in recent years to the development of many alternative detection techniques that seem to rival and challenge the conventional “old-fashioned” induction-detection approach. The aim of this manuscript is to briefly review recent advances in the field, and to provide a quantitative as well as qualitative comparison between various detection methods with an eye to future potential advances and developments. We first offer a common definition of sensitivity in magnetic resonance to enable proper quantitative comparisons between various detection methods. Following that, up-to-date information about the sensitivity capabilities of the leading recently-developed detection approaches in magnetic resonance is provided, accompanied by a critical comparison between them and induction detection. Our conclusion from this comparison is that induction detection is still indispensable, and as such, it is very important to look for ways to significantly improve it. To do so, we provide expressions for the sensitivity of induction-detection, derived from both classical and quantum mechanics, that identify its main limiting factors. Examples from current literature, as well as a description of new ideas, show how these limiting factors can be mitigated to significantly improve the sensitivity of induction detection. Finally, we outline some directions for the possible applications of high-sensitivity induction detection in the field of electron spin resonance.},

  abstract = {This paper represents a further generalization, beyond that given recently, of an earlier theory by Wangsness and the author. In common with this theory, it is assumed that the spin system is weakly coupled to its molecular surroundings and that the latter can be considered as a heat reservoir which remains in thermal equilibrium at the absolute temperature T. The condition that the coupling is weak demands that its effects upon the spin system, calculated in first and second approximation and measured in a frequency scale, are small compared to the inverse of the correlation time τc as well as of the time β=ℏkT. The principal progress over the earlier work consists in the fact that it imposes no additional conditions upon the energy of the spin system; in particular, it dispenses with the necessity that the dominant part of this energy is independent of the time. A linear differential equation of the first order for the distribution matrix is derived which is valid in this very general case and which contains the earlier results as special cases. The derivation of this Boltzmann equation is carried out in a form which is independent of any particular representation, used for the spin system, and which leads directly to a system of differential equations for the expectation values of spin functions. Beyond the earlier results, it is shown that the coupling with the molecular surroundings leads in second approximation not only to relaxation terms but also to a correction of the spin energy which has the nature of a "self-energy." As a considerably more restricted case, the situation is investigated where the dominant part of the spin energy varies little during a time of order τc and β. It is shown that, in this case, relaxation causes the distribution matrix to tend towards the form, corresponding to thermal equilibrium at the instantaneous value of the dominant part of the energy. The case where the frequencies of the spin system as well as their relative rate of variation are small compared to 1τc but arbitrary compared to 1β, is likewise discussed and shown to lead to a simple form of the Boltzmann equation. The general formalism is finally applied to a spin system with a single spin of value ½, exposed to a rotating field. One obtains in this case a phenomenological equation for the expectation value of the spin vector which is far more general than the one derived earlier; instead of requiring merely the knowledge of the longitudinal and the transverse relaxation time, relaxation is here characterized by five time constants which may all be different. The stationary solution is derived and applied to a number of familiar special cases.},

  abstract = {Approach for in vivo real-time assessment of tumor tissue extracellular pH (pHe), redox, and intracellular glutathione based on L-band EPR spectroscopy using dual function pH and redox nitroxide probe and disulfide nitroxide biradical, is described. These parameters were monitored in PyMT mice bearing breast cancer tumors during treatment with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. It was observed that tumor pHe is about 0.4 pH units lower than that in normal mammary gland tissue. Treatment with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor decreased the value of pHe by 0.3 units compared with PBS control treatment. Tumor tissue reducing capacity and intracellular glutathione were elevated compared with normal mammary gland tissue. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor treatment resulted in a decrease of the tumor tissue reducing capacity and intracellular glutathione content. In addition to spectroscopic studies, pHe mapping was performed using recently proposed variable frequency proton–electron double-resonance imaging. The pH mapping superimposed with MRI image supports probe localization in mammary gland/tumor tissue, shows high heterogeneity of tumor tissue pHe and a difference of about 0.4 pH units between average pHe values in tumor and normal mammary gland. In summary, the developed multifunctional approach allows for in vivo, noninvasive pHe, extracellular redox, and intracellular glutathione content monitoring during investigation of various therapeutic strategies for solid tumors.

Many reactions follow radical mechanisms, and many catalysts adopt paramagnetic states within their catalytic cycles where the systems exhibit species with unpaired electrons, which provide a sensitive handle to probe their geometric and electronic structure. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy directly probes these unpaired electrons to characterize molecular radicals as well as determine transition metal ion oxidation states and coordination geometries. Here, we introduce the concept of EPR followed by the methodology for in situ EPR studies and discuss high-temperature gas–solid reactions, molecular catalysis, photocatalysis and electrocatalysis. The broad applicability of the approaches is demonstrated through case studies in each area, with a focus on unravelling catalytic mechanisms. We also discuss data sharing and reproducibility issues as well as limitations to the technique. Finally, we identify directions for development to guide interested researchers towards evolving areas including miniaturization and high-frequency analysis.},

Inclusion of ringdown suppression in numerical pulse optimizations significantly reduces spectrometer deadtime when using high quality factor (high-Q) resonators, leading to increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity of inductive measurements. To demonstrate the method, we experimentally measure the free-induction decay of an inhomogeneously broadened solid-state free radical spin system at high Q. The measurement is enabled by using a numerically optimized bandwidth-limited \{OCT\} pulse, including ringdown suppression, robust to variations in static and microwave field strengths. We also discuss the applications of pulse design in high-Q resonators to universal control of anisotropic-hyperfine coupled electron-nuclear spin systems via electron-only modulation even when the bandwidth of the resonator is significantly smaller than the hyperfine coupling strength. These results demonstrate how limitations imposed by linear response theory may be vastly exceeded when using a sufficiently accurate system model to optimize pulses of high complexity.},

  abstract = {X-band rapid-scan EPR was implemented on a commercially available Bruker ELEXSYS E580 spectrometer. Room temperature rapid-scan and continuous-wave EPR spectra were recorded for amorphous silicon powder samples. By comparing the resulting signal intensities the feasibility of performing quantitative rapid-scan EPR is demonstrated. For different hydrogenated amorphous silicon samples, rapid-scan EPR results in signal-to-noise improvements by factors between 10 and 50. Rapid-scan EPR is thus capable of improving the detection limit of quantitative EPR by at least one order of magnitude. In addition, we provide a recipe for setting up and calibrating a conventional pulsed and continuous-wave EPR spectrometer for rapid-scan EPR. Food irradiation can ensure the microbial safety and shelf life extension of the global supply of fresh fruit and vegetables. Reliable detection methods for irradiated foodstuffs can greatly enhance the widespread application of irradiation technology. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy is able to directly analyze radiation-specific radicals (e.g., cellulose radicals and crystalline sugar radicals) that can serve as detection markers in irradiated foods. On the basis of these unique radiation-induced markers, the European Committee for Standardization has recommended ESR spectroscopy as a confirmatory technique for the identification of irradiated foods containing cellulose and crystalline sugar. This chapter focuses on the basic knowledge of food irradiation and the application of ESR spectroscopy in the detection of irradiated fruits and vegetables. The stability and specificity of the radiation-induced signals with respect to the shelf life of various fruit and vegetables are summarized. Recent investigations, limitations, and future research trends, particularly including different sample pre-treatments, improved detectability, and dose estimation, are also discussed. This chapter introduces some applications of electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy in food science. It explains how ESR spectra yield useful information related to irradiation or other food processing methods. Selected examples include irradiated/processed fruit, spices, herbs, and beverages. ESR signals were recorded from irradiated papaya at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K), and freeze-dried irradiated papaya at room temperature (295 K). Two side peaks from the flesh at the liquid nitrogen temperature indicated a linear dose response for 3–14 days after the γ-irradiation. The line shapes recorded from the freeze-dried specimens were sharper than those at liquid nitrogen temperature. Since 1985, there has been a very strong interest in irradiated food, thereby reflecting an increased awareness of the benefits of food irradiation. Treatment of food with ionizing radiation is increasingly being recognized as a means of reducing foodborne illnesses and associated medical and other costs. The plethora of techniques suggested for the identification of irradiated food may be classified under three broad categories: physical, chemical, and biological. An important landmark regarding the detection standards occurred in December 1996 when the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) adopted five methods as European standards for the detection of irradiated food. The procedures adopted were electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy methods for food containing bone and food containing cellulose, thermoluminescence (TL) for spices and herbs, and chemical methods based on isolation and detection of hydrocarbon and cyclobutanones in food containing fat. TL has been validated as a qualitative analysis method (EN 1788:2001) for the detection of irradiation treatment. It is based on the evaluation of the ratio between the TL intensity of the minerals separated from the food sample under investigation and of the same minerals after irradiation at 1 kGy. An electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin probe study of irradiated wheat seeds was performed depending on irradiation dose. The structural changes in the membrane integrity were followed using aqueous solutions of 4-hydroxy-TEMPO (TANOL) spin probe and a line broadening material. In the studies dry seed embryos were kept in these solutions for 150 min. The spectra were recorded at various times of air drying process. The simulation of these spectra indicated a decrease in the water content of the embryos depending on the increasing irradiation dose. This indicates the increase in the permeability of the membranes as a result of the radiation damage. From the decay curves it is possible to determine about irradiation dose, however, this approach is not very successful at close irradiation doses.},

  abstract = {ConspectusMetal ions and metallocofactors play important roles in a broad range of biochemical reactions. Accordingly, it has been estimated that as much as 25–50\% of the proteome uses transition metal ions to carry out a variety of essential functions. The metal ions incorporated within metalloproteins fulfill functional roles based on chemical properties, the diversity of which arises as transition metals can adopt different redox states and geometries, dictated by the identity of the metal and the protein environment. The coupling of a metal ion with an organic framework in metallocofactors, such as heme and cobalamin, further expands the chemical functionality of metals in biology. The three-dimensional visualization of metal ions and complex metallocofactors within a protein scaffold is often a starting point for enzymology, highlighting the importance of structural characterization of metalloproteins. Metalloprotein crystallography, however, presents a number of implicit challenges including correctly incorporating the relevant metal or metallocofactor, maintaining the proper environment for the protein to be purified and crystallized (including providing anaerobic, cold, or aphotic environments), and being mindful of the possibility of X-ray induced damage to the proteins or incorporated metal ions. Nevertheless, the incorporated metals or metallocofactors also present unique advantages in metalloprotein crystallography. The significant resonance that metals undergo with X-ray photons at wavelengths used for protein crystallography and the rich electronic properties of metals, which provide intense and spectroscopically unique signatures, allow a metalloprotein crystallographer to use anomalous dispersion to determine phases for structure solution and to use simultaneous or parallel spectroscopic techniques on single crystals. These properties, coupled with the improved brightness of beamlines, the ability to tune the wavelength of the X-ray beam, the availability of advanced detectors, and the incorporation of spectroscopic equipment at a number of synchrotron beamlines, have yielded exciting developments in metalloprotein structure determination. Here we will present results on the advantageous uses of metals in metalloprotein crystallography, including using metallocofactors to obtain phasing information, using K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy to identify metals coordinated in metalloprotein crystals, and using UV–vis spectroscopy on crystals to probe the enzymatic activity of the crystallized protein.},

A method has been developed to correct for that background signal by acquiring two sets of data, denoted as scan 1 and scan 2. In scan 2 the external field B0 is reversed and the data acquisition trigger is offset by one half cycle of the scan field relative to the settings used in scan 1. For data acquired with a cross-loop resonator subtraction of scan 2 from scan 1 cancels the background and enhances the EPR signal. Experiments were performed at an EPR frequency of about 258\,MHz, which is in the range that is commonly used for in vivo imaging. Samples include nitroxide radicals, a trityl radical, a dinitroxide, and a nitroxide in the presence of a magnetic field gradient. This method has the advantage that no assumption is made about the shape of the background signal, and it provides an approach to automating the background correction.},

The catalysts were systematically characterized by state-of-the-art techniques. With increasing Sr content, the concentration of surface oxygen vacancy defects increases, which is beneficial for cyclohexene oxidation, but the surface concentration of less active Co2+ was also increased. However, Co2+ cations have a superior activity towards peroxide decomposition, which also plays an important role in cyclohexene oxidation. A Sr doping of 20 at. \% was found to be the optimum in terms of activity and product selectivity. The catalyst also showed excellent reusability over three catalytic runs; this can be attributed to its highly stable particle size and morphology. Kinetic investigations revealed first-order reaction kinetics for temperatures between 60 and 100 °C and an apparent activation energy of 68 kJ mol−1 for cyclohexene oxidation. Moreover, the reaction was not affected by the applied O2 pressure in the range from 10 to 20 bar. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy was used to monitor the conversion of cyclohexene and the formation of reaction products including the key intermediate cyclohex-2-ene-1-hydroperoxide; spin trap electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy provided strong evidence for a radical reaction pathway by identifying the cyclohexenyl alkoxyl radical.},

  abstract = {The vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) has been receiving great attention in recent years as one of the most viable energy storage technologies for large-scale applications. However, higher concentrations of vanadium species are required in the H2O-H2SO4 electrolyte in order to improve the VRFB energy density. This might lead to unwanted precipitation of vanadium compounds, whose nature has not been accurately characterized yet. For this purpose, this study reports the preparation of V(II), V(III), V(IV) and V(V) supersaturated solutions in a 5~M H2SO4-H2O electrolyte by an electrolytic method, from the only vanadium sulfate compound commercially available (VOSO4). The precipitates obtained by ageing of the stirred solutions are representative of the solids that may form in a VRFB operated with such supersaturated solutions. The solid phases are identified using thermogravimetric analysis, X-ray diffraction and SEM. We report that dissolved V(II), V(III) and V(IV) species precipitate as crystals of VSO4, V2(SO4)3 and VOSO4 hydrates and not in their anhydrous form; conversely V(V) precipitates as an amorphous V2O5 oxide partially hydrated. The measured hydration degrees (respectively 1.5, 9, 3 and 0.26~mol of H2O per mol of compound) might significantly affect the overall engineering of VRFB operating with high vanadium concentrations.},

K-band (24GHz) EPR spectrometer seems to be a good compromise between size and sensitivity of the sample. Miniature alanine pellets were evaluated for small-field radiation dosimetry. Dosimeters of DL-alanine/PVC with dimensions of 1.5mm diameter and 2.5mm length with 5mg mass were developed. These dosimeters were irradiated with 10MV X-rays in the dose range 0.05–60Gy and the first harmonic (1h) spectra were recorded. Microwave power, frequency and amplitude of modulation were optimized to obtain the best signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). For beam profile determination, a group of 25 dosimeters were placed in an acrylic device with dimensions of (7.5×2.5×1)cm3 and irradiated with a (3×3)cm2 10MV X-rays beam field size. The dose at the central region of the beam was 20Gy at a depth of 2.2cm (build up for acrylic). The acrylic device was oriented perpendicular to the beam axis and to the gantry rotation axis. For the purposes of comparison of the spatial resolution, the beam profile was also determined with a radiographic film and 2mm aperture optical densitometer; in this case the dose was 1cGy. The results showed a similar spatial resolution for both types of dosimeters. The dispersion in dose reading was larger for alanine in comparison with the film, but alanine dosimeters can be read faster and more directly than film over a wide dose range.},

  abstract = {Environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) have aroused widespread concern due to their potential adverse health effects. Research on EPFRs in road dust is still very limited. In this study, 86 road dust samples were collected using vacuum sampling in a rapidly developing city in central China. The pollution characterization and health risk of EPFRs in the urban road dust were then systematically analyzed. The results showed the average concentrations of EPFRs in urban road dust and fraction of particle with aerodynamic diameters lower than 10 μm (PM10) were 2.24 × 1017 to 3.72 × 1019 spins·g−1 and 6.02 × 1017 to 1.41 × 1020 spins g−1, respectively. The concentrations of EPFRs in dust from expressways, arterial roads, and secondary trunk roads were significantly higher than those found in the remaining road types. The g-factors of 2.0032–2.0039 indicated that the EPFRs have consisted of oxygen-centered and carbon-centered radicals or carbon-centered radicals with nearby oxygen or halogen atoms. Moreover, three decay patterns of EPFRs were observed: a fast decay followed by a slow decay, a single slow decay, and the slowest decay. In addition, a comparative evaluation was made for probabilistic risk assessments of exposure to the EPFRs in road dust and the PM10 fraction. Compared with road dust, the probability of the number of equivalent cigarettes to exceed the 100 and 200 cigarettes for inhaling EPFRs in the PM10 fraction increased by 27.0\% and 25.0\%, respectively. The simulation results showed the PM10 fraction were primarily deposited in the upper respiratory tract regions (57.1\%) and pulmonary regions (28.8\%). The findings of this study suggest a potential risk of EPFRs in inhalable particles and provide a new insight for further exploration of the EPFRs in fine particles of road dust. E′ and Al-hole centres are some of the most common and abundant paramagnetic defects in sedimentary quartz. Here we investigate the dose dependence of these defects before and after exposure to light by electron spin resonance (ESR). Unlike the Al-hole centre, known to have only radiation-induced formation mechanisms, the E′ centre seems to possess a response to gamma dose characterised by predominantly radiation-induced annihilation at lower doses (up to about 1000 Gy) and a predominantly radiation-induced formation at higher doses, at least in the investigated dose range (up to 40 kGy) and samples. We propose these dose response mechanisms to be governed by electron trapping by E′ centre itself and by hole trapping by the oxygen deficiency centre (ODC), that seems to be the main precursor of E’ centre. We show that the ESR signals of both defects are linearly correlated during their formation as well as during their dissociation under both irradiation and sunlight exposure. The amount of E′ formed after light exposure was found to follow a saturating exponential behaviour as function of the annihilated Al-hole concentration in respect to dose, saturation being reached for doses of about 1000 Gy, probably due to the exhaustion of ODC population. As such, we propose that the origin of the unbleachable part of the Al-hole signal resides in the availability of oxygen deficiency centres which is also dependent on the accumulated gamma dose. Owing to their unique structure and specific function, layered-structure nanocarbons, including graphene oxide (GO), reduced GO (rGO), and graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), show potential activity as metal-free catalysts in heterogeneous catalytic ozonation for water purification. In this study, layered-structure nanocarbons GO, rGO, and g-C3N4 were applied as metal-free catalysts in catalytic ozonation to investigate the mechanism and driving force of reaction oxygen species formation. Although GO showed excellent catalytic activity, its instability was a decisive factor in its catalytic ozonation mechanism, due to the layered structure and chemical properties destroyed by ozone and formed free radicals. Meanwhile, the structure of rGO was preserved in catalytic ozonation, enabling a stable and kinetics-enhanced catalytic reaction. Interestingly, g-C3N4 showed activity in catalytic ozonation for refractory organic compound degradation and bromate elimination for the first time. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in-situ electron paramagnetic resonance spectra showed that surface oxygen-containing functional groups (such as OH, CO, and COOH) in layered-structure nanocarbons were sequentially reduced either by direct oxidation or by promoting ozone decomposition to form free radicals and H2O2. The original inherent delocalized electrons generated by electron-rich nitrogen vacancies in g-C3N4 promoted ozone decomposition to generate hydroxyl radicals. Through systematic study, new insights into the catalytic ozonation processes of GO, rGO, and g-C3N4 were evaluated and explained. This work presents an extensive investigation into catalytic ozonation using layered-structured nanocarbons, which will be important for the design of nanocarbons-based catalysts and improve understanding of the principles of heterogeneous catalytic ozonation. Here we present our recent studies of proton-irradiated and unirradiated ammonium hydrosulfide, NH4SH, a compound predicted to be an important tropospheric cloud component of Jupiter and other giant planets. We irradiated both crystalline and amorphous NH4SH at 10–160 K and used IR spectroscopy to observe and identify reaction products in the ice, specifically NH3 and long-chained sulfur-containing ions. Crystalline NH4SH was amorphized during irradiation at all temperatures studied with the rate being the fastest at the lowest temperatures. Irradiation of amorphous NH4SH at ∼10–75 K showed that 60–80\% of the NH4+ remained when equilibrium was reached, and that NH4SH destruction rates were relatively constant within this temperature range. Irradiations at higher temperatures produced different dose dependence and were accompanied by pressure outbursts that, in some cases, fractured the ice. The thermal stability of irradiated NH4SH was found to be greater than that of unirradiated NH4SH, suggesting that an irradiated giant-planet cloud precipitate can exist at temperatures and altitudes not previously considered. In electron spin resonance spectroscopy, spectral lineshapes are often assumed to be Voigtian. A number of researchers have suggested ways to approximate the Voigtian profile. Herein, we have devised a new quasi-analytical method to deconvolve it. In particular, we have derived an equation that relates the Lorentzian-to-Gaussian linewidth ratio directly to the product of the linewidth and the maximum value of a normalized Voigtian profile. Our calculations show that the Lorentzian and Gaussian linewidths obtained by the quasi-analytical deconvolution of computer-generated Voigtian absorption spectra are accurate within an error range of 1\% in the absence of noise. Also, simulations with noise-added spectra reveal that, in the presence of white noise, our method is valid to a certain extent that depends on several factors such as the number of data points and the spectral sweep width. The new deconvolution method is valuable in that it estimates the Lorentzian and Gaussian linewidth in a rapid manner. The method may be also useful in other fields of science, such as optical spectroscopy, especially if some a priori knowledge about the lineshape is given. Using the aqueous TiCl3H2O2 radical-generating method at 10–40°C, we have successfully characterized by EPR radicals formed from the substrates 3-buten-2-ol, I, and 1,3-butanediol, II, namely, from I, ·CH2CH(OH)CH(OH)CH3, CH2OH)CHCH(OH)CH3 and, from II, ·CH(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH3, CH2(OH)CHCH(OH)CH3, and CH2(OH)CH2C(OH)CH3. There have been earlier analogous EPR studies of ·CH2CH(OH)CH(OH)CH3 and CH2(OH)CHCH(OH)CH3 and our data agree with the results of these previous investigations when allowance is made for their incompleteness and lower resolution. The results for the hitherto unreported species ·CH(OH)CH2CH(OH)CH3 and CH2(OH)CH2C(OH)CH3 are in reasonable agreement with expectation. The data for the former radical show a particularly large α-CH proton splitting constant and, on account of the γ-C chiral center, the β-CH2 protons are inequivalent.},

  abstract = {Handling precise timing in high-speed transceivers has always been a primary design target to achieve better performance. Many different approaches have been tried, and one of those is utilizing the beneficial nature of injection locking. Though the phenomenon was not intended for building integrated circuits at first, its coupling effect between neighboring oscillators has been utilized deliberately. Consequently, the dynamics of the injection-locked oscillator (ILO) have been explored, starting from R. Adler. As many aspects of the ILO were revealed, further studies followed to utilize the technique in practice, suggesting alternatives to the conventional frequency syntheses, which tend to be complicated and expensive. In this review, the historical analysis techniques from R. Adler are studied for better comprehension with proper notation of the variables, resulting in numerical results. In addition, how the timing jitter or phase noise in the ILO is attenuated from noise sources is presented in contrast to the clock generators based on the phase-locked loop (PLL). Although the ILO is very promising with higher cost effectiveness and better noise immunity than other schemes, unless correctly controlled or tuned, the promises above might not be realized. In order to present the favorable conditions, several strategies have been explored in diverse applications like frequency multiplication, data recovery, frequency division, clock distribution, etc. This paper reviews those research results for clock multiplication and data recovery in detail with their advantages and disadvantages they are referring to. Through this review, the readers will hopefully grasp the overall insight of the ILO, as well as its practical issues, in order to incorporate it on silicon successfully.},

  abstract = {Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is a powerful technique that uses the spin of an unpaired electron as a nanoscopic probe inside a molecule to extract information about its chemical structure and composition as well as its surroundings via small changes in its resonance frequency, see Fig. 21.4.1 (left). EPR has applications in studying and monitoring a wide range of materials, starting from defects in semiconductors over free radicals in the blood to metal catalysts in hydrogen fuel production. EPR measurements are typically performed in moderate static magnetic fields around 0.3T, corresponding to EPR frequencies around 9\textbackslash mathsfGHz. This combination of field and frequency is commonly used due to the relative ease of generation of 0 3\textbackslash mathsfT magnetic fields with sufficient homogeneity as well as the required 9\textbackslash mathsfGHz frequency signal. However, access to higher frequencies and fields is strongly desirable due to higher spin polarization (with corresponding increased signal amplitude), higher spectral resolution, which allows, e.g., the determination of electronic and geometric structures of active centers in enzymes, and access to higher energy electronic transitions, such as those found in metal complexes or materials interesting for antiferromagnetic spintronics, explaining the ongoing research towards high-frequency EPR (HFEPR) with operating frequencies beyond 90\textbackslash mathsfGHz. Here, another strong driver of HFEPR is the field of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), a method that can be used to boost the relatively poor sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) by transferring the intrinsically higher electron polarization to the nuclear spins. Today, there are only a few commercial HFEPR-based DNP spectrometers on the market, with the most popular ones operating at an EPR frequency of 263\textbackslash mathsfGHz(9.4\textbackslash mathsfT), corresponding to a proton NMR frequency of 400\textbackslash mathsfMHz. These instruments use gyrotron as the source for the mm-wave magnetic field (\textbackslash mathsfB\_1 field) and cost far beyond 1 million €.},

Rotational correlation times τ c of spin probes and the intermolecular spin exchange rate constants k e were measured from EPR spectra at different temperatures and TEMPOL concentrations, and compared with the published data. The τ c values were calculated both by known equations and from the EPR spectra simulation. Rotation movements of TEMPOL in omimBF4 cannot be described by the model of the isotropic Brownian diffusion, which is valid for conventional solvents. The correct modeling of EPR spectra in RTIL can be achieved with the assumption of different rotational mobility of the spin probe around different molecular axes. The rotational, D rot, and translational, D tr, diffusion coefficients were calculated from τ c and k e values. The Debye–Stokes–Einstein law is valid in all three solvents while the dependence of D tr on T/η is not linear in Stokes–Einstein coordinates. The effective activation energy E rot a of the rotational movements in omimBF4 is noticeably higher than the corresponding values for conventional solvents, while the effective activation energies E tr a of the translational movements are comparable in all solvents studied.},

In contrast to our previous oscillator-based ESR detectors, where the ESR signal was encoded in the oscillation frequency, in the amplitude-sensitive method, the ESR signal is sensed as a change of the oscillation amplitude of the VCO. Therefore, using VCO architecture with a built-in amplitude demodulation scheme, the experimental setup reduces to a single permanent magnet in combination with a few inexpensive electronic components. We present a theoretical analysis of the achievable limit of detection, which uses perturbation-theory-based VCO modeling for the signal and applies a stochastic averaging approach to obtain a closed-form expression for the noise floor. Additionally, the paper also introduces a numerical model suitable for simulating oscillator-based ESR experiments in a conventional circuit simulator environment. This model can be used to optimize sensor performance early on in the design phase. Finally, all presented models are verified against measured results from a prototype VCO operating at 14 GHz inside a 0.5 T magnetic field.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The saturation behaviour of an electron spin resonance line depends on the rate at which energy, absorbed from the microwave field by a relatively small number of resonant spins, is shared with the remainder of the spin system through the process of spectral diffusion or cross relaxation. This rate, being dependent on the spin-spin interactions, offers a possible means for their study in dilute spin systems. With this object, a general theory of saturation has been developed. It is based on the theory of Provotorov which has been successful in accounting for saturation and related effects in nuclear magnetic resonance. Whereas Provotorov's theory regards the spectral diffusion process as instantaneous (the case of homogeneous broadening), our approach takes account of the finite rate and is therefore applicable to dilute spin systems and inhomogeneously broadened lines. As a result of the generality of our method, the results of Provotorov, Portis, Wolf and Bloembergen et al. occur as special cases. Measurements are described on a copper complex at 4 °k which support the thermodynamic model on which the theory is based. Where more than two levels are involved, flip-flop transitions connecting one of the saturated levels with a third level transfer local field energy away from the saturated levels. A consequence is that the theory of Bloembergen et al. becomes applicable. Absorption and dispersion saturation measurements made without field modulation on ruby at 4 °k confirm this.},

We were capable of reducing the noise variance in a single trace by a factor of 11.3 which is equivalent to reduction in time by the same factor. This factor can be quite significant especially when signal averaging must be performed over the span of many hours to days. This technique may also be tailored to conventional electron spin resonance experiments and other techniques where signal averaging is utilized.

The temperature during the withering and kilning steps in malt production had a direct influence on the generation of stable organic radicals in the finished malt, whereby higher temperatures resulted in greater radical concentrations. The majority of organic radicals in pilsner malt were bound in the husk and, therefore, did not significantly transfer into the wort and subsequent beer. In roasted malts, the organic radicals were distributed more uniformly throughout the kernel. Furthermore, depending on the organic radical content and Maillard reaction products present in the endosperm of crystal and roasted malts, more oxidation reactions took place during the mashing, and there was higher radical formation during the wort boiling process. Consequently, the endogenous antioxidant potential value and sulfur dioxide content in the final beer were reduced. These results indicate that there is a direct link between organic radicals in the endosperm generated by the kilning temperature during the malting process and color as an indicator of Maillard reaction products and the oxidative stability of the resultant beer.},

Fast, easy, and dependable assays for predicting lipid oxidation rates in foods are important for shelf-life prediction. In this study, an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spin-trapping technique with N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN) was tested to determine the lag phase of lipid oxidation in stripped soybean oil (SSO), SSO with added α-tocopherol, and commercial soybean, canola and corn oils. EPR intensity of spin-trapped products from SSO correlated well with lipid hydroperoxides formation for samples stored at 37 and 55~°C respectively. When the antioxidant α-tocopherol was added, the EPR signal intensity of oil samples increased—indicating sample deterioration—after 50–65\% of α-tocopherol was consumed. When using the EPR method with commercial soybean, canola or corn oil stored at 55~°C, there was a poor relationship between EPR intensity and lipid hydroperoxides lag phases. However, a linear correlation was found between EPR signal intensity and hexanal formation. For example, EPR signal intensity lag phases were 5, 13 and 27~days for soybean, canola and corn oils, respectively which was similar to the hexanal lag phases of 5, 13 and 25~days for the same oils. The EPR spin-trapping assay method has several advantages over headspace hexanal measurements, especially with regard to easier sample handling and shorter analysis times.},

However, quantitative EPR (Q-EPR) is not so simple as the relation is. Direct quantitative measurements are practically excluded, the comparison of both standard and unknown sample EPR signals (indirect determination) is rather used, as a rule. The accuracy of spin number determination is an essential problem of quantitative EPR. The experimental conditions and instrumental variables influencing the signal shape and intensity may lower the accuracy of quantitative determinations. There is different sensitivity of various line parameters to the instrumental distortions and experimental conditions. Thus, the optimal setting of instrumental variables controlling the distortions depends on the procedure being used for quantitative determinations. The aspects of sensitivity of different Q-EPR procedures to instrumental distortions, as well as the rules of optimal setting of these parameters are the subject of this review.},

When the lossy sample was in a tube with an internal radius of 0.064 cm and the Dewar insert was present in the cavity, cavity Q and unsaturated integrated signal intensity decreased by up to a factor of 3, relative to the values for a nonlossy solvent at the same incident microwave power. The lens effect of the solvent increased the integrated signal intensity by up to 55\%. The lens effect of the Dewar insert caused the integrated signal intensity to increase by a factor of 2.48. In the presence of the Dewar insert, cavity Q and resonant frequency were about 2.2 and 3.5 times more sensitive, respectively, to the changes in solvents ϵ′ and ϵ″ than those values in the absence of the Dewar. The lens effects of the solvents were about the same in the presence and absence of the Dewar.},

  abstract = {Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy of paramagnetic species in single crystals is a powerful tool for characterizing the latter’s magnetic interaction parameters in detail. Conventional ESR systems are optimized for millimeter-size samples and make use of cavities and resonators that accommodate tubes and capillaries in the range 1-5 mm. Unfortunately, in the case of many interesting materials such as enzymes and inorganic catalytic materials (e.g., zeolites), single crystals can only be obtained in micron-scale sizes (1-200 µm). To boost ESR sensitivity and to enable experiments on microcrystals, the ESR resonator needs to be adapted to the size and shape of these specific samples. Here, we present a unique family of miniature surface resonators, known as “ParPar” resonators, whose mode volume and shape are optimized for such micron-scale single crystals. This approach significantly improves upon the samples’ filling factor and thus enables the measurement of much smaller crystals than was previously possible. We present here the design of such resonators with a typical mode dimension of 20-50 µm, as well as details about their fabrication and testing methods. The devices’ resonant mode(s) are characterized by ESR microimaging and compared to the theoretical calculations. Moreover, experimental ESR spectra of single microcrystals with typical sizes of ∼25-50 µm are presented. The measured spin sensitivity for the 50-µm resonator at cryogenic temperatures of 50 K is found to be ∼1.8 × 106 spins/G √Hz for a Cu-doped single crystal sample that is representative of many biological samples of relevance.},

Despite intense interest in the toxicity of PM2.5, the mechanisms by which it causes illnesses are poorly understood. Since the principal source of airborne fine particles is combustion and combustion sources generate free radicals, we suspected that PM2.5 may contain radicals. Using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), we examined samples of PM2.5 and found large quantities of radicals with characteristics similar to semiquinone radicals. Semiquinone radicals are known to undergo redox cycling and ultimately produce biologically damaging hydroxyl radicals. Aqueous extracts of PM2.5 samples induced damage to DNA in human cells and supercoiled phage DNA. PM2.5-mediated DNA damage was abolished by superoxide dismutase, catalase, and deferoxamine, implicating superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide, and the hydroxyl radical in the reactions inducing DNA damage.},

Samples with a high-defect density (Ns{$>$}1017 cm−3) exhibit a resonant quenching effect which is attributed to spin-dependent tunneling of localized band-tail electrons to singly occupied defect states (dangling bonds). In low-defect material an additional quenching resonance is observed which is identified with spin-dependent diffusion (thermalization) of localized band-tail holes to doubly occupied dangling bonds. The results confirm our recombination model in which trapped electrons and holes recombine via defect states by tunneling and diffusion rather than by capture of free carriers.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate that adiabatic and fast passage ultra-wideband (UWB) pulses can achieve inversion over several hundreds of MHz and thus enhance the measurement sensitivity, as shown by two selected experiments. Technically, frequency-swept pulses are generated by a 12 GS/s arbitrary waveform generator and upconverted to X-band frequencies. This pulsed UWB source is utilized as an incoherent channel in an ordinary pulsed EPR spectrometer. We discuss experimental methodologies and modeling techniques to account for the response of the resonator, which can strongly limit the excitation bandwidth of the entire non-linear excitation chain. Aided by these procedures, pulses compensated for bandwidth or variations in group delay reveal enhanced inversion efficiency. The degree of bandwidth compensation is shown to depend critically on the time available for excitation. As a result, we demonstrate optimized inversion recovery and double electron electron resonance (DEER) experiments. First, virtually complete inversion of the nitroxide spectrum with an adiabatic pulse of 128ns length is achieved. Consequently, spectral diffusion between inverted and non-inverted spins is largely suppressed and the observation bandwidth can be increased to increase measurement sensitivity. Second, DEER is performed on a terpyridine-based copper (II) complex with a nitroxide-copper distance of 2.5nm. As previously demonstrated on this complex, when pumping copper spins and observing nitroxide spins, the modulation depth is severely limited by the excitation bandwidth of the pump pulse. By using fast passage UWB pulses with a maximum length of 64ns, we achieve up to threefold enhancement of the modulation depth. Associated artifacts in distance distributions when increasing the bandwidth of the pump pulse are shown to be small.},

  abstract = {Monitoring the formation of dendrites or filaments of lithium is of paramount importance for Li-based battery technologies, hence the intense activities in designing in situ techniques to visualize their growth. Herein we report the benefit of correlating in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and EPR imaging to analyze the morphology and location of metallic lithium in a symmetric Li/LiPF6/Li electrochemical cell during polarization. We exploit the variations in shape, resonance field and amplitude of the EPR spectra to follow, operando, the nucleation of sub-micrometric Li particles (narrow and symmetrical signal) that conjointly occurs with the fragmentation of bulk Li on the opposite electrode (asymmetrical signal). Moreover, in situ EPR correlated spectroscopy and imaging (spectral-spatial EPR imaging) allows the identification (spectral) and localization (spatial) of the sub-micrometric Li particles created by plating (deposition) or stripping (altered bulk Li surface). We finally demonstrate the possibility to visualize, via in situ EPR imaging, dendrites formed through the separator in the whole cell. Such a technique could be of great help in mastering the Li-electrolyte interface issues that plague the development of solid-state batteries.},

  abstract = {The Heisenberg spin exchange behavior of several radical–solvent systems has been studied. This work has shown that k, the second‐order rate constant for bimolecular encounters, and |\,J\,| τ1 (where |\,J\,| is twice the exchange integral and τ1 is the lifetime of the collision pair) depend markedly on the ionic strength of the solution and upon the size and charge of the radical. For the peroxylamine disulfonate radical in a 5\,×\,10−2M solution of 1:2 electrolyte, our simple analysis yields |\,J\,| τ1\,∼\,0.95 and k\,=\,2.0\,×\,10+9M−1·sec−1 at 24°C; increasing the electrolyte concentration to 6.1\,×\,10−1M gives |\,J\,| τ1\,∼\,1.3 and k\,=\,3.2\,×\,109M−1·sec−1. These changes in k and |\,J\,| τ1 are attributed to screening by the electrolyte of the charge of the dianion radical; this is discussed in terms of the Debye theory. The di‐tertiarybutyl nitroxide (DTBN) radical undergoes apparent strong exchange (|\,J\,| τ1\,≫\,1) in pure water (k\,=\,2.4\,×\,109M−1·sec−1 at 24°C). The dependence of the exchange frequency (ωHE) on added 1:2 electrolyte is of the form ωHE\,=\,ωHE(0) exp(−\,CE\,/\,C′), where CE is the molar electrolyte concentration and ωHE(0) the exchange frequency in pure water; for a 2.4\,×\,10−2M DTBN solution C′\,=\,0.23\,±\,0.02M. This reduction of exchange frequency with electrolyte concentration is attributed to the formation of DTBN aggregates. The durosemiquinone radical undergoes strong exchange in dimethoxyethane (k\,=\,2.9\,×\,109M−1·sec−1at 15°C). The closeness of k to the diffusion‐controlled limit indicates that ion pairing takes place in solution. The tetraphenyl arsonium peroxylamine disulfonate radical undergoes apparent weak exchange (|\,J\,| τ1\,\&lt;\,1) in dimethyl sulfoxide. However, rapid radical decay made quantitative study of exchange impossible for this radical.},

The effects of Heisenberg exchange on the linewidths of the tetracyanoethylene anion (TCNE−) radical and the di‐tert‐butyl nitroxide (DTBN) radical in both dimethoxyethane (DME) and tetrahydrofuran (THF) are investigated. From comparative studies of linewidth as a function of temperature and of radical concentration, TCNE− in DME is shown to undergo strong exchange with a second‐order rate constant of 4.1\,±\,0.6\,×\,109M−1·sec−1 at 15°C. The TCNE− radical in THF exhibits an anomalous concentration‐dependent linewidth effect when compared to the theory and to the experiments employing DME as the solvent. The uncharged DTBN radical shows similar spin‐exchange properties in both solvents. Possible mechanisms for the anomalous linewidth effect are discussed. The effect of spin exchange on the saturation parameters of the TCNE− radical in DME is investigated in detail, and the experimental results are shown to agree, within experimental error, with the theory developed. Electron–nuclear dipolar and electron–electron dipolar relaxation effects are discussed in terms of their (small) contributions to the experimentally determined relaxation times.},

  abstract = {Free radicals are thought to be key intermediates in the oxidation of wine, but their nature has not been established. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to detect and identify several free radical species in wine under oxidative conditions with the aid of spin traps. The 1-hydroxylethyl radical was the sole radical species observed when α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone was used as a spin trap in a heated (55 °C), low-sulfite (15 mg L−1) red wine. This radical appears to arise from ethanol oxidation via the hydroxyl radical, and this latter species was confirmed by using a high concentration (1.5 M) of the 5,5-dimethylpyrroline-N-oxide spin trap, thus providing the first direct evidence of the Fenton reaction in wine. Hydroxyl radical formation in wine was corroborated by converting hydroxyl radicals to methyl radicals by its reaction with dimethyl sulfoxide. The novel spin trap 5-tert-butoxycarbonyl 5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide was also used in this study to identify sulfite radicals in wine for the first time. This spin trap has also been shown to trap hydroperoxyl radicals, the generation of which is predicted in wine; however, no evidence of this species was observed.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) detection system that can wirelessly transmit continuous wave (CW) EPR data over distances up to 30 cm with minimal degradations in SNR. The proposed system comprises a VCO-based EPR-on-a-chip (EPRoC) sensor with a spin sensitivity of \$2 \textbackslash times 10\textasciicircum 12\textbackslash;\textbackslash textspins/\textbackslash sqrt \textbackslash textHz \$, a 14-bit oversampling ΣΔ-modulator, a 7 GHz bandwidth-tunable ultra-wideband (UWB) transmitter chip, and a custom-designed 2 GHz-bandwidth elliptical dipole antenna. On the receiver side, we directly digitize the antenna signal and recover the EPR signal in the digital domain via a discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-based demodulation scheme. The presented platform is the first wirelessly connected EPR detection system that allows for in-situ EPR experiments using EPRoC detectors under variable operation conditions while enabling direct wireless access to the experimental data. The estimated bit error rate (BER) of the link at a distance of 10 cm from the transmitter is 1×10-7.},

Sedimentation and gel filtration are hydrodynamic techniques that can be used for this medium resolution structural analysis. This review collects a number of simple calculations that are useful for thinking about protein structure at the nanometer level. Readers are reminded that the Perrin equation is generally not a valid approach to determine the shape of proteins. Instead, a simple guideline is presented, based on the measured sedimentation coefficient and a calculated maximum S, to estimate if a protein is globular or elongated. It is recalled that a gel filtration column fractionates proteins on the basis of their Stokes radius, not molecular weight. The molecular weight can be determined by combining gradient sedimentation and gel filtration, techniques available in most biochemistry laboratories, as originally proposed by Siegel and Monte. Finally, rotary shadowing and negative stain electron microscopy are powerful techniques for resolving the size and shape of single protein molecules and complexes at the nanometer level. A combination of hydrodynamics and electron microscopy is especially powerful.},

The development of new materials for Li-ion batteries is the focus of research in prominent groups in the field of materials science throughout the world. Li-ion batteries can be considered to be the most impressive success story of modern electrochemistry in the last two decades. They power most of today's portable devices, and seem to overcome the psychological barriers against the use of such high energy density devices on a larger scale for more demanding applications, such as EV. Since this field is advancing rapidly and attracting an increasing number of researchers, it is important to provide current and timely updates of this constantly changing technology. In this review, we describe the key aspects of Li-ion batteries: the basic science behind their operation, the most relevant components, anodes, cathodes, electrolyte solutions, as well as important future directions for R\&D of advanced Li-ion batteries for demanding use, such as EV and load-leveling applications.},

The calibrations are presented as line heights or integrated sectional areas of the difference spectra, for the three diagnostic regions sensitive to axial and off axial rotations.

This line-sample configuration is commonly used in biological applications. Measurements using a “point” sample of aqueous peroxylamine disulfonate as a probe demonstrated that the origins of these effects are the inhomogeneities in the microwave and modulation fields along the cavity axis and the position-dependent effects of dielectric loss on cavity Q. It is illustrated that compensations can be made for these effects for point samples by changing incident microwave power and modulation amplitude. These results emphasize the need to use small samples. For line samples an allowance for microwave field inhomogeneity is proposed using an empirical calibration between calculated cavity filling factor and experimentally determined microwave field amplitude. In this way the mean square microwave field over the sample is maintained constant. Correction is not made for the modulation field inhomogeneity and for this reason, the samples must still be kept small. Revised correlation time calibrations are presented which were obtained from the saturation transfer ESR spectra of 5-mm line samples recorded according to this new, standardized protocol.},

  abstract = {This article introduces the fundamental concepts, a general methodology, and the tools for following the quantum evolution of the electron magnetic moments during some basic pulse EPR experiments using electron and nuclear angular momentum operators. After a general introduction, we define the electron magnetic moment and the single-electron spin Zeeman Hamiltonian in terms of angular momentum operators. The eigenstates of the electron in an external magnetic field are derived and their time dependence is presented in vector form. To describe macroscopic systems, it is necessary to introduce the spin density operator describing ensembles of electron spin states and the Liouville–von Neumann rate equation that is used to describe the dynamics of the system. We then proceed to the introduction of the rotating frame, and the effect of microwave (MW) irradiation on the electron spin is described by the rate equations for the expectation values of the components of its magnetic moment vector operator. The influence of spin relaxation is discussed only briefly. After introducing the abovementioned general concepts, the effects of MW pulses on the electron spin are described using the angular momentum operator expansions and their mutual transformation rules. We then proceed with an example showing how the tools presented are used to calculate the spin dynamics during the application of the two-pulse Hahn echo for a single electron spin, S = 1/2 system. In the following section, the single-electron spin system is extended to a coupled two-electron spin system. Here, the orthogonal set of product angular momentum operators used to express the Hamiltonian and the spin density operator are presented and are used to calculate the evolutions of this spin system during a three-pulse electron–electron double-resonance (DEER) experiment designed to measure the dipolar and exchange interaction between the two spins. The last section deals with an electron-nucleus spin system. It starts with defining its product angular momentum operators and their linear combinations resulting in the fictitious spin-1/2 operators. Supported by their mutual transformation rules, it is then shown how to use it to calculate the two-pulse electron-spin echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) sequence. Finally, we also briefly describe how to calculate the spin evolution in Davies- and Mims- electron–nuclear double-resonance sequences (ENDOR).},

Human, porcine, and Rhodobacter sphaeroides ETF–QO each contain a single [4Fe–4S]2+,1+ cluster and one equivalent of FAD, which are diamagnetic in the isolated enzyme and become paramagnetic on reduction with the enzymatic electron donor or with dithionite. The anionic flavin semiquinone can be reduced further to diamagnetic hydroquinone. The redox potentials for the three redox couples are so similar that it is not possible to poise the proteins in a state where both the [4Fe–4S]+ cluster and the flavoquinone are fully in the paramagnetic form. Inversion recovery was used to measure the electron spin-lattice relaxation rates for the [4Fe–4S]+ between 8 and 18K and for semiquinone between 25 and 65K. At higher temperatures the spin-lattice relaxation rates for the [4Fe–4S]+ were calculated from the temperature-dependent contributions to the continuous wave linewidths. Although mixtures of the redox states are present, it was possible to analyze the enhancement of the electron spin relaxation of the FAD semiquinone signal due to dipolar interaction with the more rapidly relaxing [4Fe–4S]+ and obtain point-dipole interspin distances of 18.6±1Å for the three proteins. The point-dipole distances are within experimental uncertainty of the value calculated based on the crystal structure of porcine ETF–QO when spin delocalization is taken into account. The results demonstrate that electron spin relaxation enhancement can be used to measure distances in redox poised proteins even when several redox states are present.},

  abstract = {A unique dual mode X-band Continuous Wave (CW) EPR resonator designed for simultaneous EPR measurement and rapid microwave (MW) induced sample heating is described. Chemical reactions subjected to a flow of energy and matter can be perturbed away from the thermodynamic equilibrium by imposing a rapid shock or physical change to the system. Depending on the magnitude of the perturbation, these changes can dictate the subsequent evolution of the entire system, allowing for instance to populate non-equilibrium reactive intermediate states. Temperature jump (T-jump) experiments are a common method to achieve such perturbations. Most T-jump experiments are based on Joule Heating methods or IR lasers. Here we demonstrate the principle of rapid sample heating based on microwaves. The benefits of MW heating include (i) rapid and efficient heating (i.e. using a tuned resonant cavity, {$>$}99\% efficient power transfer to the sample can be achieved), and (ii) volumetric heating (i.e. the entire sample volume rises in temperature at once, since heat is generated in the sample instead of being transferred to it). Accordingly, the key concept of the design is the use of a cavity resonator allowing EPR detection (at 9.5~GHz) and simultaneous sample heating (at 6.1~GHz). Temperature increments of 50~°C within a few seconds are possible. This is evidenced and illustrated here by probing the temperature-induced variation of the rotational dynamics of 16-doxyl stearic acid methyl ester (16-DSE) spin probe grafted on the surface of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) micelles in water, as well as copper (II) acetylacetonate in chloroform. Rapid changes in the rotational dynamics of the paramagnetic centres provide direct evidence for the in situ and simultaneous EPR measurement-heating capabilities of the resonator. Improvements afforded by the use of pulsed MW sources will enable faster heating time scales to be achieved. In the longer term, this current study demonstrates the simple and direct possibilities for using MW heating as a means of performing T-jump experiments.},

  abstract = {A general theory of the linewidths in the electron spin resonance spectra of dilute solutions of free radicals has been developed in terms of the relaxation‐matrix theory of Bloch, Redfield, and Ayant. In contrast to previous theories, it is shown that a composite line arising from a set of degenerate nuclear‐spin states should, in general, consist of a sum of superimposed lines of Lorentzian shape with different widths rather than a single line with an over‐all Lorentzian shape. A single Lorentzian line is still obtained, however, as a limiting case when the variation of the widths of the different components of a composite line is small compared to the average width. Although the non‐Lorentzian shape of a composite line is often difficult to observe experimentally, a number of other observable properties are predicted by the present development that are outside the scope of the previous theories. For example, linewidth effects resulting from differences in the widths of the separate components of a composite line are predicted that explain the alternation in the linewidths from one hyperfine line to another recently observed in the ESR spectra in certain free radicals. The detailed form of the relaxation matrix is presented for intramolecular anisotropic and isotropic electron—nuclear dipolar interactions, quadrupole interactions, and g‐tensor relaxations. Modulations of the spin density and hyperfine splittings are included, as are internal motions, and a number of cross terms between the different relaxation mechanisms arise. In general the relaxation matrix of a composite line contains significant off‐diagonal elements, and the determination of the linewidths requires the evaluation of the eigenvalues of the matrix. Problems involving rapid chemical exchange, or modulation by jumps to a small number of sites, can be treated by the relaxation‐matrix theory and, under special restrictions, by either the modified Bloch equations or the Anderson theory of motional narrowing. When applicable, these latter procedures can be used over the entire range of exchange rates, while the relaxation‐matrix theory is limited to fast rates only.},

  abstract = {Exposure to particulate silica (most crystalline polymorphs) causes a persistent inflammation sustained by the release of oxidants in the alveolar space. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which include hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and singlet oxygen, are generated not only at the particle surface, but also by phagocytic cells attempting to digest the silica particle. Two distinct kinds of surface centers—silica-based surface radicals and poorly coordinated iron ions—generate O2•− and HO• in aqueous solution via different mechanisms. Crystalline silica is also a potent stimulant of the respiratory burst in phagocytic cells with increased oxygen consumption and production of O•−, H2O2, and \{NO\} leading to acute inflammation and HO• generation in the lung. Oxidative stress elicited by crystalline silica is also evidenced by increased expression of antioxidant enzymes such as manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase, and the enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Generation of oxidants by crystalline silica particles and by silica-activated cells results in cell and lung injury, activation of cell signaling pathways to include MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, increased expression of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factorα [TNFα], interleukin-1 [IL-1]), and activation of specific transcription factors (e.g., NFκB, AP-1). Silica can also initiate apoptosis in response to oxygen- and nitrogen-based free radicals, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased gene expression of death receptors, and/or their ligands (TNFα, Fas ligand [FasL]).},

Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to determine the properties of positive electrolyte systems. The optimum amount of additives was identified as wt\% 0.004 and 0.010 for α-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3, respectively. The surface morphology and composition of electrodes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. A plausible reaction mechanism was also proposed for redox reaction occurring on the positive electrode of a VRB. The adsorption of V(V) ions to the electrode surface from the solution increased by the time additives were added into the system. γ-Al2O3 showed the best anti-precipitation effects for the V(V) ion at 40~°C and 60~°C in the precipitation tests. In the battery test, the discharge capacity of γ-Al2O3 with a positive electrolyte, was the highest at 87.2~mAh. According to thermal and electrochemical studies, γ-Al2O3 can be a useful additive for the positive electrolyte of a VRB.},

Preliminary results indicate a further increase in T1 at 95 GHz. At each microwave frequency, T1 varies monotonically with position in the EPR line. T1 is longer near the parallel axis and shorter in the perpendicular plane of the g-axis system. T1 is interpreted in terms of coupling to local vibrational modes of the defect center.

However, the lack of detailed studies keeps the exact structure, aggregation mechanism, and interaction with complex composites of the PDS still disputable. In this contribution, detailed electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) investigations, including advanced fast field cycling dynamic nuclear polarization, of heavy crude oil focused on vanadyl complexes are presented. A perceptible room-temperature 1H dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) solid effect at the X-band (magnetic field of 300–400 mT corresponding to the EPR frequency of 9.5 GHz and NMR frequency of 14.6 MHz), with enhancement ±5, is observed at moderate microwave irradiation power in crude oil with a high concentration of VO2+, while no Overhauser DNP contribution is found. Using NMR T2-encoding, DNP spectra and molecular dynamics, two components are distinguished, from which the one with slower dynamics exhibits higher DNP enhancement via VO2+ complexes. The observed difference is discussed in terms of electron–nuclear interaction and relative parts of hyperpolarized nuclear spins using an advanced model for DNP data simulation.},

The virtues of the bridge are its simple and flexible design and its relatively high output power (0.7W) that generates π pulses of 25ns and a microwave field, B1=0.71 mT. Such a high B1 enhances considerably the sensitivity of high field double electron-electron resonance (DEER) measurements for distance determination, as we demonstrate on a nitroxide biradical with an interspin distance of 3.6nm. Moreover, it allowed us to carry out HYSCORE (hyperfine sublevel-correlation) experiments at 95GHz, observing nuclear modulation frequencies of 14N and 17O as high as 40MHz. This opens a new window for the observation of relatively large hyperfine couplings, yet not resolved in the EPR spectrum, that are difficult to observe with HYSCORE carried out at conventional X-band frequencies. The correlations provided by the HYSCORE spectra are most important for signal assignment, and the improved resolution due to the two dimensional character of the experiment provides 14N quadrupolar splittings.},

  abstract = {A quantitative method for the analysis of EPR spectra from dinuclear Mn(II) complexes is presented. The complex [(Me3TACN)2Mn(II)2(μ-OAc)3]BPh4 (1) (Me3TACN=N, N′,N′′-trimethyl-1,4,7-triazacyclononane; OAc=acetate1−; BPh4=tetraphenylborate1−) was studied with EPR spectroscopy at X- and Q-band frequencies, for both perpendicular and parallel polarizations of the microwave field, and with variable temperature (2–50K). Complex 1 is an antiferromagnetically coupled dimer which shows signals from all excited spin manifolds, S=1 to 5. The spectra were simulated with diagonalization of the full spin Hamiltonian which includes the Zeeman and zero-field splittings of the individual manganese sites within the dimer, the exchange and dipolar coupling between the two manganese sites of the dimer, and the nuclear hyperfine coupling for each manganese ion. All possible transitions for all spin manifolds were simulated, with the intensities determined from the calculated probability of each transition. In addition, the non-uniform broadening of all resonances was quantitatively predicted using a lineshape model based on D- and r-strain. As the temperature is increased from 2K, an 11-line hyperfine pattern characteristic of dinuclear Mn(II) is first observed from the S=3 manifold. D- and r-strain are the dominate broadening effects that determine where the hyperfine pattern will be resolved. A single unique parameter set was found to simulate all spectra arising for all temperatures, microwave frequencies, and microwave modes. The simulations are quantitative, allowing for the first time the determination of species concentrations directly from EPR spectra. Thus, this work describes the first method for the quantitative characterization of EPR spectra of dinuclear manganese centers in model complexes and proteins. The exchange coupling parameter J for complex 1 was determined (J=−1.5±0.3cm−1; Hex=−2JS1·S2) and found to be in agreement with a previous determination from magnetization. The phenomenon of exchange striction was found to be insignificant for 1.},

Although this move would suggest a blossoming of System-EPR as a specific, non-invasive monitor of Fe/S (dys)homeostasis in whole cells, a review of the literature reveals limited success possibly due to technical difficulties in adherence to EPR spectroscopic and biochemical standards.

Azotobacter chroococcum and Klebsiella pneumoniae exhibit excited-state EPR signals with g= 10.4, 5.8 and 5.5 with a maximal amplitude in the temperature range of 20- 50 K. The magnitude of these effective g values, combined with the temperature dependence of the peak area at g= 10.4 from 12 K to 86 K, are consistent with an S= 7/2 system with spin Hamiltonian parameters D=−3.7 ± 0.7 cm−1, [E] = 0.16 ± 0.01 cm−1 and g= 2.00. This interpretation predicts nine additional effective g values some of which have been detected as broad features of low intensity at g∼ 10, ∼ 2.5 and ∼ 1.8. The S= 7/2 EPR is ascribed to the multi-iron exchange-coupled entities known as the P clusters. Quantification relative to the S= 3/2 EPR signal from dithionite-reduced MoFe protein indicates a stoichiometry of one P cluster per FeMo cofactor. Two possible interpretations for these observations, together with data from the literature, are proposed. In the first model there are two P clusters per tetrameric MoFe protein. Each P cluster encompasses approximately 8Fe ions and releases a total of three electrons on oxidation with excess thionine. In the second model the conventional view of four P clusters, each containing approximately 4Fe, is retained. This alternative requires that following one-electron oxidation, the P clusters factorize into two populations, Pa and Pb, only one of which is further oxidized with thionine resulting in the S= 7/2 system. Both models require eight-electron oxidation of tetrameric MoFe protein to reach the S= 7/2 state.},

The tumor aqueous microviscosity, 1.8 ± 0.1 centipoise, was significantly lower than that of the corresponding normal tissue, 2.9 ± 0.3 centipoise, a difference of 38 ± 7\%. These results confirm the commonly observed increase in the water proton transverse relaxation times (T2) in magnetic resonance imaging of hyperproliferative states, for example, malignancy. The specificity of the localization of the EPR signal indicates a substantial portion of the T2 increase seen in magnetic resonance imaging derives from decreased bulk-water viscosity. The effect of this microviscosity differences may be the basis of several physiological differences between tumors and normal tissues which could confer a growth rate advantage to tumor tissue.},

For these samples at room temperature, T1 is 200 μs and T2 ranged from 35 to 200 μs, depending on spin concentration. At X band with 100-kHz modulation frequency and 1-G modulation amplitude there was minimal lineshape difference between the low-power, in-phase spectra and high-power spectra detected 90° out-of-phase with respect to the magnetic field modulation. Signal enhancement, defined as the ratio of the intensities of the out-of-phase to the in-phase signals when B1 for both observation modes is adjusted to give maximum signal, was 3.4 to 9.5 at room temperature. The origin of the out-of-phase signal was modeled by numerical integration of the Bloch equations including magnetic field modulation. The waveforms for the E′ signal, prior to phase sensitive detection, were simulated by summing the contributions of many individual spin packets. Good agreement was obtained between experimental and calculated waveforms. At low B1 the experimental values of T1 and T2 were used in the simulations. However, at higher B1, T2 was adjusted to match the experimental signal intensity and increased with increasing B1. At high B1, T2=T1, consistent with Redfield's and Hyde's models. For the spin concentrations examined, the out-of-phase signals at very high power (B1∼0.33 G) displayed a linear relationship between peak-to-peak signal amplitude and spin concentration. Under the conditions used for spin quantitation the signal-to-noise for these spectra was up to 5 times higher than for the in-phase signal, which greatly facilitates quantitation for these types of samples. For samples in which T2 is dominated by electron spin–spin interaction, lower spin concentration results in longer T2 and the enhancement is increased.},

  abstract = {Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) is the gold standard for studying paramagnetic species. As an example, in structural biology, it allows to extract information about distance distributions on the nanometer scale via site-directed spin labeling. Conventional pulsed EPR of biological samples is currently limited to relatively large sample concentrations and cryogenic temperatures, mainly due to low sensitivity and the significant dead time associated with conventional resonator-based EPR setups, essentially precluding in-cell EPR under physiological conditions. This paper presents our latest progress toward single-cell pulsed EPR using VCO-based EPR-on-a-chip (EPRoC) sensors. Together with an analytical model for VCO-based pulsed EPR, we present an experimental scheme to perform dead-time-free pulsed EPR measurements using EPRoC detectors. The proposed scheme is validated using extensive numerical simulations and proof-of-concept experiments on the spin dynamics of an organic radical at room temperature using a custom-designed EPRoC detector operating in the Ka-band around 30.4~GHz. Additionally, we discuss methods to improve the excitation field homogeneity and sample handling through chip post-processing and custom-designed microfluidics. Finally, we present our progress towards compact, portable pulsed EPR spectrometers incorporating EPRoC detectors, microfluidics, and custom-designed permanent magnets. Such portable EPR spectrometers can pave the way toward new EPR applications, including point-of-care diagnostics.},

  abstract = {Surface coil resonators have been widely used to perform topical EPR spectroscopy. They are usually positioned adjacent to or implanted within the body. For EPR applications these resonators have a number of important advantages over other resonator designs due to their ease of sample accessibility, mechanical fabrication, implementation of electronic tuning and coupling functions, and low susceptibility to sample motions. However, a disadvantage is their B1 field inhomogeneity, which limits their usefulness for 3D imaging applications. We show that this problem can be addressed by mapping and correcting the B1 field distribution. We report the use of EPR imaging (EPRI) to map the B1 distribution of a surface coil resonator. We show that EPRI provides a fast, accurate, and reliable technique to evaluate the B1 distribution. 3D EPRI was performed on phantoms, prepared using three different saline concentrations, to obtain the B1 distribution. The information obtained from the phantoms was used to correct the images of living animals. With the use of this B1 correction technique, surface coil resonators can be applied to perform 3D mapping of the distribution of free radicals in biological samples and living systems.

The first-derivative spectrum of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) powder was measured with this FM method. Frequency modulation of up to 1.6MHz (peak-to-peak) was achieved at a microwave carrier frequency of 1.1GHz. This corresponds to a magnetic field modulation of 57μT (peak-to-peak) at 40.3mT. By using a tunable microwave resonator and automatic control systems, we achieved a practical continuous-wave (CW) EPR spectrometer that incorporates the FM method. In the present experiments, the EPR signal intensity was proportional to the magnitude of frequency modulation. The background signal at the modulation frequency (1kHz) for EPR detection was also proportional to the magnitude of frequency modulation. An automatic matching control (AMC) system reduced the amplitude of noise in microwave detection and improved the baseline stability. Distortion of the spectral lineshape was seen when the spectrometer settings were not appropriate, e.g., with a lack of the open-loop gain in automatic tuning control (ATC). FM is an alternative to field modulation when the side-effect of field modulation is detrimental for EPR detection. The present spectroscopic technique based on the FM scheme is useful for measuring the first derivative with respect to the microwave frequency in investigations of electron-spin-related phenomena.},

The changes in the structural properties of a series of films grown under a variation of the dilution of the process gas silane in hydrogen, which induces a transition from highly crystalline to amorphous growth, were investigated. The evolution of the crystalline volume fraction was quantitatively analysed by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The results confirm the need for proper correction of the Raman data for optical absorption and Raman cross-section. Transmission electron microscopy was used to investigate the characteristics and the variation in the microstructure. Upon increasing the silane concentration the strong columnar growth with narrow grain boundaries degrades towards the growth of small irregularly shaped grains enclosed in an amorphous matrix. Simultaneously, the initial film growth becomes predominantly amorphous. Spherical voids with a diameter up to 14nm and ‘crack-like’ cavities (which accumulate at the film—substrate interface in the highly crystalline growth regime) were observed. Relaxation reactions of strained bonds within a growth zone of the order of a few tens of nanometres and preferential etching are proposed to govern the growth process.},

  abstract = {Abstract In portions of the magnetic resonance community, there is a misunderstanding of the process of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal generation and reception, and even in accepted texts, it is frequently described in terms of absorption and emission of radio waves, or radiation, by a two‐level quantum system. While this explanation can be refuted, for those who do understand that the NMR free induction decay signal is easily explained by Faraday's law of induction, reconciling the presence of an induced electromotive force with an apparent absence of transitions between nuclear energy levels causes conceptual problems. This difficulty is examined, and an explanation of the signal given whereby Faraday's law is explained simply in terms of an exchange of virtual photons. The article thus attempts to reconcile the standard engineering approach to signal reception with a quantum mechanical description of the NMR phenomenon. Radiation damping and its relations to detection of the induced signal and to signal‐to‐noise ratio are then scrutinized, and the misleading nature of the appellation noted. In the process, it is shown that while damping is inherently necessary for signal detection and the transfer of energy that it entails, the degree of such damping depends on the efficiency of the detector—in other words, of the preamplifier in the NMR receiver—and can therefore be minimized. Mathematics in the article is kept to a minimum; proofs of the Principle of Reciprocity description of Faraday's law for reception of both signal and noise from a conducting sample are given in an appendix. ©1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

At the four electrodes, nitrobenzene and the other members of the family are reduced to aniline via hydrazobenzene upon exhaustive electrolysis at −2.35 V vs. Ag/AgNO3 (0,05 M). The electrochemical reversibility of the nitrobenzene/nitrobenzene radical anion and of the azoxybenzene/azoxybenzene radical anion couples is decreased by the presence of oxides at the surface of copper and nickel. The presence of oxides has little influence on the reversibility of the nitrosobenzene/nitrosobenzene radical anion and azobenzene/azobenzene radical anion couples.},

The water splitting reaction occurs inside the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC) via a Mn4CaO5 cluster. To elucidate the reaction mechanism, detailed structural information for each intermediate state of the OEC is required. Despite the current high-resolution crystal structure of PSII at 1.85 Å and other efforts to follow the structural changes of the Mn4CaO5 cluster using X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) crystallography in addition to spectroscopic methods, many details about the reaction mechanism and conformational changes in the catalytic site during water oxidation still remain elusive. In this study, we present a rarely found successful application of the conventional macroseeding method to a large membrane protein like the dimeric PSII core complex (dPSIIcc). Combining microseeding with macroseeding crystallization techniques allowed us to reproducibly grow large dPSIIcc crystals with a size of ∼3 mm. These large crystals will help improve the data collected from spectroscopic methods like polarized extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) and single crystal electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques and are a prerequisite for determining a three-dimensional structure using neutron diffraction.},

The slow tumbling results show particularly good agreement with the slow tumbling theory of Freed, et ai, for a reorientational model of moderate jumps (ca. 50° rms), and essentially isotropic reorientation. It is shown that while such a model may not be readily distinguished, purely from its slow tumbling spectral predictions, from a free diffusion model including inertial effects, the latter model is incompatible with most other considerations. However, a simple analysis explicitly including the fluctuating (or random) torques indicates that more fundamental analysis of the dynamics may explain the slow tumbling results without necessarily involving substantial jumps. The spectral analysis is considerably enhanced by the increased resolution obtained from the use of the perdeuterated spin probe and deuterated solvents. Careful analysis of results at X-band and 35 GHz has shown that the nonsecular spectral densities exhibit significant deviations from a Debye- like spectral density yielding results very similar to those recently reported for the peroxylaminedisulfon- ate (PADS) radical. Related observations are discussed of apparent non-Debye-like spectral densities in the incipient slow tumbling spectra. These anomalies are also found to be amenable to a unified explana- tion in terms of the fluctuating torques. The analysis of much of the results in terms of a simple model yields an rms value for the fluctuating torques of ca, V6kT and tm  \textasciitilde{}  tr where tm is the relaxation time of the torques. The high-temperature electron-spin flip processes are consistent with a Hubbard-type spin- rotational mechanism, but the low-temperature results may be due to spin-rotational relaxation from in- tramolecular motions. The simple analysis of spin-rotational relaxation in terms of relaxation of the fluc- tuating torques is found to yield equivalent predictions to conventional treatments when the estimated values of rms torque and tm are used.},

The rationale for this hypothesis is based on the observation that the dispersion spectrum becomes more intense than the absorption spectrum at high incident powers. The rationale is dependent on optimization of high microwave efficiency (Λ; mT/W1/2) and low-quality factor (Q-value) sample~resonators as well as the use of microwave sources with reduced phase noise. Microwave frequencies from 1.2 to 94~GHz are considered. Although the dispersion display appears to be observable with an adequate signal-to-noise ratio for most EPR research initiatives, a weakness of microwave bridges for studies at high incident microwave power was identified. Spurious leakage of incident microwave power through the circulator, thereby bypassing the probe leading to the resonator, can result in a decreased signal-to-noise ratio in both absorption and dispersion because of phase noise. For dispersion EPR with low Q-value sample resonators, this leakage is the primary contributor to phase noise at the receiver. In this work, we focus on the design of microwave reflection bridges and discuss possible methods to ameliorate this source of noise.},

Rectangular TE102 and cylindrical TE011 are common modes at X-band even though the field varies cosinusoidally along the Z-axis. The authors found a way to create a uniform field (UF) in these modes. A length of waveguide at cut-off was introduced for the sample region, and tailored end sections were developed that supported the microwave resonant mode. This work is reviewed here. The radio frequency (RF) magnetic field in loop-gap resonators (LGR) at X-band is uniform along the Z-axis of the sample, which is a benefit of LGR technology. The LGR is a preferred structure for EPR of small samples. At Q- and W-bands, the LGR often exhibits nonuniformity along the Z-axis. Methods to trim out this nonuniformity, which are closely related to the methods used for UF cavity resonators, are reviewed. In addition, two transmission lines that are new to EPR, dielectric tube waveguide and circular ridge waveguide, were recently used in UF cavity designs that are reviewed. A further benefit of UF resonators is that cuvettes for aqueous samples can be optimum in cross section along the full sample axis, which improves quantification in EPR spectroscopy of biological samples.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a novel experiment on nitroxide radical spin labels using a multiarm EPR W-band bridge with a loop-gap resonator (LGR). We demonstrate EPR spectroscopy of spin labels by linear sweep of the microwave frequency across the spectrum. The high bandwidth of the LGR, about 1 GHz between 3 dB points of the microwave resonance, makes this new experiment possible. A frequency-tunable yttrium iron garnet (YIG) oscillator provides sweep rates as high as 1.8 × 105 GHz/s, which corresponds to 6.3 kT/s in magnetic field-sweep units over a 44 MHz range. Two experimental domains were identified. In the first, linear frequency sweep rates were relatively slow, and pure absorption and pure dispersion spectra were obtained. This appears to be a practical mode of operation at the present level of technological development. The main advantage is the elimination of sinusoidal magnetic field modulation. In the second mode, the frequency is swept rapidly across a portion of the spectrum, and then the frequency sweep is stopped for a readout period; FID signals from a swept line oscillate at a frequency that is the difference between the spectral position of the line in frequency units and the readout position. If there is more than one line, oscillations are superimposed. The sweep rates using the YIG oscillator were too slow, and the portion of the spectrum too narrow to achieve the full EPR equivalent of Fourier transform (FT) NMR. The paper discusses technical advances required to reach this goal. The hypothesis that trapezoidal frequency sweep is an enabling technology for FT EPR is supported by this study.},

Similar results were obtained for Umbilicaria species from the Karkonosze Mountains. Distribution of semiquinone radicals in lichen thalli was also investigated. The action of nitrogen dioxide on Umbilicaria species resulted in the synthesis of iminoxy radicals in the thalli. The intensification of the semiquinone free radical production in lichen thalli from atmospherically polluted environments and the degradation of lichen acids to β-diketone compounds would appear to be parallel processes. The properties of the iminoxyls derived from β-diketones in the lichen matrix (anisotropic spectra at room temperature) and in organic solutions after extraction procedure were also examined by EPR.},

The investigations were carried out on raw materials and extracted fractions of humic acids (HA). General trends of g value and spin concentration changes were found. These parameters in lichens strongly depend on lichen species and air pollution. Determination of the g value and semiquinone spin concentration allows to assess degree of transformation of organic matter in compost, soil, peat and lignite. Application of gaseous ammonia as a base penetrating the organic matrices extends the possibilities and usefulness of the method. Interaction of metal ions with humic materials is illustrated by interaction of VO2+ ion with peat and lignite HA as well as demineralised (raw and carbonised) brown coal. Our investigations demonstrate that quantitative EPR is a rapid and effective monitoring method to study the influence of various environmental factors on substances containing polyphenolic matrices.},

Signals for LiPc were obtained with a split-ring resonator, a rectangular resonator and a dielectric resonator. At faster scan rates the small bandwidth of the high-Q dielectric resonator filters, out high-frequency components of the rapid-scan signals. Field inhomogeneities induced by the rapidly changing magnetic field increase with scan rate and are greater with the dielectric and split-ring resonantors than with the rectangular resonator. Data for trityl-CD3 were recorded with the rectangular resonator. The extended trityl sample, about 3 mm long, shows larger effects of magnetic field inhomogeneities than the small LiPc crystals.},

Furthermore, it is demonstrated that both the derivative shape of the lines in standard cw EPR spectra and the distortions due to overmodulation are caused by the unresolved sideband pattern of these lines. The single-photon transition does not even give a contribution to the first-harmonic cw EPR signal. Multiple photon transitions are described semiclassically in a toggling frame and their existence is proven using second quantization. With the toggling frame approach and perturbation theory an effective Hamiltonian for an arbitrary sideband transition is derived. Based on the effective Hamiltonians an expression for the steady-state density operator in the singly rotating frame is derived, completely describing all sidebands in all modulation frequency harmonics of the cw EPR signal. The relative intensities of the sidebands are found to depend in a very sensitive way on the actual rf amplitude and the saturation of single sidebands is shown to depend strongly on the effective field amplitude of the multiple photon transitions. By comparison with the analogous solutions for frequency-modulation EPR it is shown that the field-modulation and the frequency-modulation technique are not equivalent. The experimental data fully verify the theoretical predictions with respect to intensities and lineshapes.},

  abstract = {The photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanoparticles in aqueous solutions is commonly evaluated by monitoring the rate of methylene blue bleaching and phenols degradation, but both substrates suffer from many drawbacks, e.g., the high capacity of dark adsorption, self-degradation, and photosensitization. Besides, filtration is always required to separate the particulate photocatalyst before the analysis. Herein, we investigated the potential use of electron paramagnetic resonance~(EPR) and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPOL) to directly monitor the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 suspensions without the need for filtration. The results showed that TEMPOL aqueous solution is in the dark and under UV-A illumination, does not absorb UV-A and visible light, and has negligible dark adsorption. The influence of TEMPOL concentration, light intensity, and TiO2 loading on the photocatalytic deactivation rate has been investigated. The mechanisms of TEMPOL deactivation in the presence and absence of oxygen as well as in the presence of methanol •OH radicals’ scavenger have been discussed. The photocatalytic deactivation products have been analyzed using EPR, 1H-NMR, and 13C-NMR spectroscopies. It is found that the deactivation of TEMPOL is initiated by •OH radicals and α-H abstraction from the 4-piperidine position followed by the formation of TEMPONE (4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) and 4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine). In the presence of methanol, the formed α-hydroxyl radicals (•CH2OH) attack the nitroxide side of TEMPOL and produce 4-hydroxy-tetramethylpiperidine. Same activity trends have been observed for the photocatalytic methanol oxidation and TEMPOL deactivation over different types of TiO2 photocatalysts evincing that the proposed method has a potential for direct monitoring of the activities of photocatalyst suspensions.},

  abstract = {A preliminary account is given of attempts to perform ELDOR spectroscopy utilizing a pulsed EPR spectrometer that operates in the saturation-recovery mode for measurements of electron spin-lattice relaxation times. The procedure is to saturate one of the hyperfine lines with a pulse of high microwave power, shift the magnetic field at the end of the microwave pulse within a time shorter than the electronic T1 to the resonant value of another hyperfine component, and measure the saturation transfer that has taken place by monitoring the EPR signal intensity as a function of time as in a conventional saturation-recovery experiment. The saturation transfer has been measured as a function of the microwave pulse width and the peak power of the saturating microwave pulse in order to establish that the extent of saturation transfer is related to the extent of saturation of the transition which was directly saturated in the first instance. The studies are carried out on 2,5-ditertiary butyl p-benzosemiquinone ion in ethanol. The lack of signal-averaging techniques in these preliminary experiments forces the use of a high free radical concentration (10−2M) leading to considerable overlap between hyperfine components-the spectral overlap aiding saturation transfer. However, these preliminary experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of the field-pulsed ELDOR method in the investigation of saturation transfer. By a minor modification of the pulsing circuit, it has been possible to obtain linear magnetic field scans of the order of 6 G at the maximum rate of 1 G/μsec. Since the spectrometer has a response time of the order of 3 μsec, it should be possible to obtain EPR spectra of transient species with lifetimes of the order of 10 μsec or longer by such rapid scan techniques.},

Several additives are also evaluated at 45 °C in a vanadium redox flow cell operating with a 2 m vanadium electrolyte. In the case of the cell employing the blank solution, a sudden drop in capacity, followed by pump failure is observed after around 70 cycles, while the cells with the additives continue to cycle without failure for 120 and 150 cycles for ammonium sulphate and ammonium phosphate additives respectively. A similar stabilising effect has previously been observed with these additives at low temperatures in the negative half-cell electrolyte of the VRB, confirming that these stabilising agents have the potential to extend the upper and lower operating temperature limits of a 2 m vanadium electrolyte in the VRB to 45 and 5 °C respectively, while also significantly enhancing its energy density without the need for potentially hazardous chloride additions.},

While previously presented amplitude-sensitive VCO-based readout schemes displayed an inferior sensitivity compared to frequency-sensitive readouts, the proposed amplitude-sensitive method matches the sensitivity of frequency detection while allowing the operation of the VCO at a lower current. This, in turn, lowers the array power consumption, thereby, reducing the risk of heating the EPR samples and mitigating the cooling requirements. Moreover, the lower bias currents and VCO amplitudes reduce the risk of signal degradation due to a saturation of the EPR resonance lines. The proposed method has been validated using the 12-channel VCO-based EPR-on-a-chip detector. In these measurements, both the amplitude and the frequency-sensitive detection methods achieve a spin sensitivity of 6\textbackslash times 10\textasciicircum 9\textbackslash mathrms\textbackslash mathrmp\textbackslash mathrmi\textbackslash mathrmn\textbackslash mathrms/\textbackslash sqrt\textbackslash mathrmH\textbackslash mathrmz.},

The homemade rectangular cavity resonator in X-band shows higher unloaded quality factor compare with standard cavity resonator in the TE102 mode. Because the inner walls of rectangular cavity resonator are treated through high quality polishing and high purity Au plating. Also the inner walls are made by printed circuit board which has thin Cu foil, two problems such as mechanical vibration and thermal expansion can be solved by minimizing unwanted eddy current. Through the ferromagnetic resonance measurement by using our rectangular cavity resonator, we can be obtained reasonable values of resonance frequency and linewidth by using NiFe thin film. As a result, the Gilbert damping constant from the experimental result is in good agreement with the typical value of damping parameter of the NiFe thin film.},

The width arises from the distribution of nuclear moment components. Theoretical calculations of the width are in good agreement with observation provided that the F-center wave function is treated as a linear combination of atomic orbitals; wave functions calculated on continuum models are shown to be unsatisfactory. The theory is confirmed by a comparison of observations on F centers in crystals of K39Cl and K41Cl. If the width is attributed to interactions with the nearest sets of K and Cl ions, the experiments lead directly to quantitative values of the electronic charge density at the K and Cl nuclei: one finds |Ψ(K)|2=0.70×1024 cm−3 and |Ψ(Cl)|2=0.12×1024 cm−3.},

The echo-detected (ED) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) lineshape reveals strong dependence on the time interval τ between the echo-forming microwave pulses which is readily explained by anisotropic phase relaxation. Employing a librational model of molecular motion and the Redfield relaxation theory, spectra were simulated for the τ's varying in a large interval. The anisotropic relaxation rate increases with temperature increase and it is larger for nitroxide with a larger molecular size. The mean-squared amplitude of motion, obtained from reduced hyperfine splitting in continuous-wave EPR, near Tg linearly depends on temperature which is characteristic of harmonic solids. For tempone in a host crystal 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-cyclobutan-1, 3-dione the anisotropic spin relaxation rate decreases with temperature increase so the found feature solely belongs to a glassy state. A new approach is proposed for modeling slow wobbling motion in a restricted angular space.},

The proposed MW resonator offers an alternative solution for compact in-field measurements, such as low-field magnetic resonance (MR) experiments requiring convenient sample exchange. A microstrip line was used to inductively couple MWs into the resonator. We characterised the proposed resonator topology by electromagnetic (EM) field simulations, a field perturbation method, as well as by return loss measurements. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra at X-band frequencies were recorded, revealing an electron-spin sensitivity of 3.7·1011spins·Hz-1/2G-1 for a single EPR transition.

Spectra of arrestin spin-labeled at site 267 were recorded at room temperature as a function of microwave power. The separation of irradiating microwave frequencies, Δf, was 10kHz, and a newly-designed multiquantum Q-band electron paramagnetic resonance bridge was utilized, operating in a superheterodyne detection mode. The sample volume was 30nL using a 3-loop–2-gap resonator. Most spectra were obtained at a 300μM concentration in single, 2-min scans, but spectra were also successfully obtained at 30μM, corresponding to one picomole of protein. Enhanced sensitivity to T1 and T2 was evident in the spectra, and linewidths varied considerably across the spectra. The pure absorption displays are beneficial relative to field modulation methods for spectral characterization. The presence of two states of the nitroxide spin-label with different relaxation times is evident, particularly in the dispersion spectra, which are expected to exhibit enhanced sensitivity to lineshape variation relative to absorption. Feasibility has been established for the use of this technique for site-directed spin-labeling studies of biologically relevant samples, particularly the study of protein structure and dynamics.},

This deviation is shown to be caused by the incomplete description of the electrochemical double layers within the cell when calculating the OCV using the Nernst equation adopted from fuel cell literature. Here, we propose a more complete description of the Nernst equation, which accounts for two additional electrochemical mechanisms that exist in a VRFB, namely: i) the proton activity at the positive electrode due to the involvement of the protons in the redox reaction, and ii) the Donnan potential due to the proton concentration differences across the membrane. The complete form of the Nernst equation proposed herein accurately predicts the reported experimental data with an average error of 1.2\%, showing a significant improvement over the incomplete Nernst equation (8.1\% average error) currently used in VRFB models.},

However, gCN suffers from rapid charge-carrier recombination, inefficient light absorption, and poor long-term stability which greatly hinders photocatalytic performance. To determine the underlying catalytic mechanisms and overall contributions that will improve performance, the electronic structure of gCN materials has been investigated using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. Through lineshape analysis and relaxation behavior, evidence of two independent spin species were determined to be present in catalytically active gCN materials. These two contributions to the total lineshape respond independently to light exposure such that the previously established catalytically active spin system remains responsive while the newly observed, superimposed EPR signal is not increased during exposure to light. The time dependence of these two peaks present in gCN EPR spectra recorded sequentially in air over several months demonstrates a steady change in the electronic structure of the gCN framework over time. This light-independent, slowly evolving additional spin center is demonstrated to be the result of oxidative processes occurring as a result of exposure to the environment and is confirmed by forced oxidation experiments. This oxidized gCN exhibits lower H2 production rates and indicates quenching of the overall gCN catalytic activity over longer reaction times. A general model for the newly generated spin centers is given and strategies for the alleviation of oxidative products within the gCN framework are discussed in the context of improving photocatalytic activity over extended durations as required for future functional photocatalytic device development.},

In this work we introduce a method for EPR-based pH mapping utilizing a method of spectral-spatial imaging of sequentially scanned spectra to decrease the missing gradient rotation angle, without increasing the spatial field of view. Repeated in vitro measurements of pH phantom tubes demonstrated higher precision measurements of the hyperfine coupling constant (HFC) compared to previous EPR-based methods, resulting in mean pH values accurate to less than 0.1 pH across a range of physiologically observed values.},

In this paper, we investigated solvent compatibility of Parylene C in a range of solvents with regard to swelling of it and the change in its surface roughness at room temperature. The results of Parylene C swelling were associated with solubility parameter, δ (cal/cm3)1/2, which is predicted from the parameters of dispersion, polar, and hydrogen-bonding forces. Solvents that swelled Parylene C film layer mostly were benzene, chloroform, trichloroethylene, and toluene, while methanol, 2-propanol, ethylene glycol, and water did not cause any swelling. Subsequently, the adverse effects of diffusion of solvents through a Parylene C film layer were demonstrated by stripping of the encapsulated photoresist. In addition, a comparison was made between Parylene C and poly(dimethyl)siloxane (PDMS) considering the data of swelling ratios obtained from the experimental findings and the literature, respectively. Experimental findings showed that Parylene C is much more compatible to solvents than PDMS in high-throughput microfluidic and packaging applications. These results will be of great value to scientists for understanding compatibility of any selected solvent on Parylene C in the applications of micro devices.},

  abstract = {After a brief summary of the ideas underlying the quantum theory of dispersion it is shown that it can be applied to the refraction of x-rays, although the assumption that the number of atoms in a wave length cube is large is no longer satisfied. A general formula for the index of refraction in terms of the atomic absorption coefficient α and the critical frequencies is given. From the condition, experimentally verified, that the electrons in the atom for impressed frequencies, large compared to their natural frequencies, shall act like free electrons as far as the index of refraction is concerned, a relation is obtained for α. From the failure of this relation when applied to the groups of electrons separately, conclusions are drawn as to the coupling of the groups. Some considerations on the origin of the Compton shifted radiation are added, from which it appears that in the wave description this radiation must be regarded as coming from all the atoms and as being coherent with the incident waves; a result suited to stress the difficulty of harmonizing the wave picture with that of quantum processes in the atoms.1},

Thus, HFEPR is advantageous in investigating (S=1/2)V(IV) species due to its higher g-factor resolution over conventional EPR, albeit at the price of losing the hyperfine structure resolution due to g-strain. It is very much desirable in characterizing (S=3/2) V(II) complexes since it is capable of precisely and accurately measuring the zero-field splitting present in these species. Finally, HFEPR is indispensable in investigating (S=1)V(III) species, which in conventional conditions are often “EPR-silent” due to the combination of their large zero-field splitting and integer spin number. The use of HFEPR thus can provide additional information regarding the oxidation state of the metal and the coordination geometry.},

This article reports on the development of a versatile on-substrate electrode setup for spectroelectrochemical Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) measurements on redox conductive polymers for ORBs. Quantitative in operando EPR experiments performed on electrochemical cells with a di-TEMPO Ni-Salen polymer as active electrode material demonstrate a strong decrease in the number of paramagnetic centers upon oxidizing the film. The distinct EPR signatures of the TEMPO-containing polymer and its fragments in different molecular environments are used to study its degradation upon repeated cycling. A comparison between the number of EPR-active sites and the number of electrochemically active charges, as measured by cyclic voltammetry, provides information on the nature of the degradation process. Low-temperature ex situ pulse EPR measurements on the oxidized polymer film reveal the spectrum of dilute nitroxide species, which may be associated with electrochemically inactive islands. These experiments pave the way for advanced EPR techniques for accurately determining distances between adjacent paramagnetic centers and thus for identifying performance-limiting loss mechanisms, which can eventually help develop strategies for making ORBs powerful contenders on the path towards sustainable electrochemical power sources.},

To enable quantitative measurements using EPRoC devices, the spatial distribution of the B1 field produced by the VCOs must be known. As an example, the field distribution of a 12-coil VCO array EPRoC operating at 14 gigahertz is described in this study. The frequency modulation–recorded EPR spectra of a “point”-like and a thin-film sample were investigated while varying the position of both samples in three directions. The results were compared to COMSOL simulations of the B1-field intensity. The EPRoC array sensitive volume was determined to be \textasciitilde 19 nanoliters.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is the method of choice to investigate and quantify paramagnetic species in many scientific fields, including materials science and the life sciences. Common EPR spectrometers use electromagnets and microwave (MW) resonators, limiting their application to dedicated lab environments. Here, novel aspects of voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based EPR-on-a-Chip (EPRoC) detectors are discussed, which have recently gained interest in the EPR community. More specifically, it is demonstrated that with a VCO-based EPRoC detector, the amplitude-sensitive mode of detection can be used to perform very fast rapid-scan EPR experiments with a comparatively simple experimental setup to improve sensitivity compared to the continuous-wave regime. In place of a MW resonator, VCO-based EPRoC detectors use an array of injection-locked VCOs, each incorporating a miniaturized planar coil as a combined microwave source and detector. A striking advantage of the VCO-based approach is the possibility of replacing the conventionally used magnetic field sweeps with frequency sweeps with very high agility and near-constant sensitivity. Here, proof-of-concept rapid-scan EPR (RS-EPRoC) experiments are performed by sweeping the frequency of the EPRoC VCO array with up to 400 THz s\textsuperscript{−1}, corresponding to a field sweep rate of 14 kT s\textsuperscript{−1}. The resulting time-domain RS-EPRoC signals of a micrometer-scale BDPA sample can be transformed into the corresponding absorption EPR signals with high precision. Considering currently available technology, the frequency sweep range may be extended to 320 MHz, indicating that RS-EPRoC shows great promise for future sensitivity enhancements in the rapid-scan regime.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Both as-implanted and annealed samples were studied. The inelastically scattered x rays were removed by fitting the energy spectrum for the scattered x rays. The atomic scattering factor of silicon, previously known reliably up to 20 Å−1, has been extended to 55 Å−1. The radial distribution function of amorphous Si, before and after annealing, has been determined through an unbiased Fourier transformation of the normalized scattering data. Gaussian fits to the first neighbor peak in these functions shows that scattering data out to at least 40 Å−1 is required to reliably determine the radial distribution function. The first-shell coordination number increases from 3.79 to 3.88 upon thermal annealing at 600 °C, whereas that of crystalline Si determined from similar measurements on a Si powder analyzed using the same technique is 4.0. Amorphous Si is therefore under coordinated relative to crystalline Si. Noise in the distribution function, caused by statistical variations in the scattering data at high-momentum transfer, has been reduced without affecting the experimental resolution through filtering of the interference function after subtracting the contribution of the first-neighbor peak. The difference induced by thermal annealing in the remainder of the radial distribution functions, thus revealed, is much smaller than previously believed.},

  abstract = {The development of pulse electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy at microwave frequencies above 100\,GHz is rather challenging and expensive due to the low output power of modern high-frequency solid state electronics. However, there is a number of scientific problems that require spin relaxation measurements at THz frequencies. The rapid scan ESR is an alternative technique that does not require high microwave power and still provides information on the spin relaxation times. The method takes advantage of fast sweeps of the excitation microwave frequency over the ESR line. When the frequency sweep reaches a sufficiently high rate, distinct oscillations (also called wiggles) appear in the ESR spectrum. These oscillations bear information about T2 electron spin relaxation time, which can be extracted via fitting the rapid scan spectrum using the modified Bloch equations. In this Perspective Letter, we introduce the recent advances in this technique and discuss the future steps necessary to make the THz rapid scan ESR a convenient and easy to use tool.},

  abstract = {A novel EPR stopped-flow accessory is described which allows time-dependent cw-EPR measurements of rate constants of reactions involving paramagnetic species after rapid mixing of two liquid reagents. The EPR stopped-flow design represents a state-of-the-art, computer controlled fluid driving system, a miniresonant EPR structure with an integrated small ball mixer, and a stopping valve. The X-band EPR detection system is an improved version of that reported by Sienkiewicz et al. [Rev. Sci. Instr. 65 (1994) 68], and utilizes a resonator with two stacked ceramic dielectric rings separated by a variable spacer. The resonator with the mode TE(H)011 is tailored particularly for conditions of fast flowing and rapidly stopped aqueous solutions, and for a high time resolution. The short distance between the ball mixer and the small EPR active volume (1.8μl) yields a measured dead time of 330μs. A compact assembly of all parts results in minimization of disturbing microphonics. The computer controlled driving system from BioLogic with two independent stepping motors was optimized for EPR stopped-flow with a hard-stop valve. Performance tests on the EPR spectrometer ESP 300E from BRUKER using redox reactions of nitroxide radicals revealed the EPR stopped-flow accessory as an advanced, versatile, and reliable instrument with high reproducibility.},

From the EPR spectra intensities measured at 77 and 293K, Fe3+ ions were evidenced in the form of clusters and agglomerated species. Fe3+ agglomerated species were observed mainly for winds blowing from the industrial park. Cascade impactor samples study evidenced that clusters are rather detected in the small size particles whereas agglomerated Fe3+ ions species are rather present in the large ones. The small size particles are richer in iron than the large ones, thus such particles play an important role in the value of EPR parameters.},

The investigation focuses on the relationship between the electrochemical performance and electrolyte compositions at both the positive and negative half-cells. Although the concentration of total vanadium ions remains nearly constant at both sides over cycling, the net transfer of solution from one side to the other and thus the asymmetrical valance of vanadium ions caused by the subsequent disproportionate self-discharge reactions at both sides lead to capacity fading. Through in situ monitoring of the hydraulic pressure of the electrolyte during cycling at both sides, the convection was found to arise from differential hydraulic pressures at both sides of the separators and plays a dominant role in capacity decay. A capacity-stabilizing method is developed and was successfully demonstrated through the regulation of gas pressures in both electrolyte tanks.},

E.s.r. spectra for all systems in the entire temperature range were simulated, using the Brownian diffusion motional model. The rotational correlation time τc of the cation at 300K in the membranes swollen by water, in ionomer solutions in water and in neat water are all similar, and suggest that the cation is located in large water ‘pools’. This conclusion is in agreement with the expected phase separation of the ionomer into polar and non-polar domains that leads to a reverse micellar structure. For the alcohols, however, the e.s.r. spectra and corresponding τc values of the cation in the swollen membrane and in ionomer solutions are similar, but clearly different from those measured in the neat solvents; these results were explained by assuming that the alcohols penetrate into the perfluorinated regions, and form small solvent pools with a diameter {$<$}20 Aå, where the motion of the cation is highly hindered.},

In order to implement rebalancing control, online states-of-charge have to be monitored. In this paper, the electrolyte viscosity and its use for online state-of-charge monitoring design are investigated. The study firstly measures the viscosities of both V2+/V3+ and VO2+/VO2+ redox couples in sulfuric acid as the negative and positive half-cell electrolytes at different states-of-charge and temperatures, followed by establishing an empirical neural network model that correlates the state-of-charge to viscosity and temperature. To overcome the limitation in online viscosity measurements, Darcy’s law describing the flow of a fluid through a porous medium is further introduced to link the electrolyte viscosity to the pressure drop across a porous medium where the electrolyte solutions flow through. Together with the neural network model, the state-of-charge can be eventually represented as a function of pressure, temperature and flow rate that are readily measurable online, and accordingly an online state-of-charge monitoring design is developed, which could be readily integrated into the online battery control system for automated electrolyte rebalance. Experimental validation is performed on a 15-cell stack system and the results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {We have performed calculations, verified by experiment, to explain why the sensitivity of biological EPR can be dramatically increased by dividing the aqueous sample into separate compartments. In biological EPR, the major factor affecting sensitivity is the number of spins in the sample. For an aqueous sample at ambient temperature, this is limited by the requirement for a small volume, due to strong non-resonant absorption of microwaves by water. However, recent empirical studies have shown that this volume limitation can be greatly relieved by dividing the aqueous sample into separate volumes, which allows much more aqueous sample to be loaded into a resonant cavity without significant degradation of the cavity quality factor. Calculations, based on the Bruggeman mixing rule, show quantitatively that the composite aqueous sample has a permittivity much less than that of bulk water, depending on the aqueous volume fraction f. Analysis for X-band EPR spectroscopy shows that the optimal volume fraction of an aqueous composite sample, producing maximum sensitivity, is f = 0.15, increasing the sensitivity by a factor of 8.7, compared with an aqueous sample in a single tube. EPR resonators on the basis of standing-wave cavities are optimised for large samples. For small samples it is possible to design different resonators that have much better power handling properties and higher sensitivity. Other parameters being equal, the sensitivity of the resonator can be increased by minimising its size and thus increasing the filling factor. Like in NMR, it is possible to use lumped elements; coils can confine the microwave field to volumes that are much smaller than the wavelength. We discuss the design and evaluation of EPR resonators on the basis of planar microcoils. Our test resonators, which operate at a frequency of 14 GHz, have excellent microwave efficiency factors, achieving 24 ns π/2 EPR pulses with an input power of 17 mW. The sensitivity tests with DPPH samples resulted in the sensitivity value 2.3 × 109 spins · G−1Hz−1/2 at 300 K. 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D)/α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) dioxygenase (TfdA) is an Fe(II)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the first step in degradation of the herbicide 2,4-D. The active site structures of a small number of enzymes within the α-KG-dependent dioxygenase superfamily have been characterized and shown to have a similar HXDX 50–70HX 10RXS arrangement of residues that make up the binding sites for Fe(II) and α-KG. TfdA does not have obvious homology to the dioxygenases containing the above motif but is related in sequence to eight other enzymes in the superfamily that form a distinct consensus sequence (HX(D/E)X 138–207 HX 10R/K). Variants of TfdA were created to examine the roles of putative metal-binding residues and the functions of the other seven histidines in this protein. The H167A, H200A, H213A, H245A, and H262A forms of TfdA formed inclusion bodies when overproduced in Escherichia coli DH5α; however, these proteins were soluble when fused to the maltose-binding protein (MBP). MBP-TfdA exhibited kinetic parameters similar to the native enzyme. The H8A and H235A variants were catalytically similar to wild-type TfdA. MBP-H213A and H216A TfdA have elevated K m values for 2,4-D, and the former showed a decreased k cat, suggesting these residues may affect substrate binding or catalysis. The H113A, D115A, MBP-H167A, MBP-H200A, MBP-H245A and MBP-H262A variants of TfdA were inactive. Gel filtration analysis revealed that the latter two proteins were highly aggregated. The remaining four inactive variants were examined in their Cu(II)-substituted forms by EPR and electron spin-echo envelope modulation (ESEEM) spectroscopic methods. Changes in EPR spectra upon addition of substrates indicated that copper was present at the active site in the H113A and D115A variants. ESEEM analysis revealed that two histidines are bound equatorially to the copper in the D115A and MBP-H167A TfdA variants. The experimental data and sequence analysis lead us to conclude that His-113, Asp-115, and His-262 are likely metal ligands in TfdA and that His-213 may aid in catalysis or binding of 2,4-D. The design, production, and performance of relatively simple, economical, and easy-to-build loop–gap resonators made of copper-clad Teflon (CuFlon) are described. Resonators were built at microwave frequencies between 1 and 9.4 GHz. A C-band continuous wave spectrum, an L-band electron spin-echo signal, and an L-band saturation-recovery signal for irradiated fused silica standard samples are presented. Experimental X-band electron-spin-echo measurements are in agreement with theoretical predictions that larger spin-echo signals are obtained at the detector when the resonator Q is reduced by overcoupling than when the same resonator Q is achieved by losses in the resonator, and that, to achieve the same B1 at the sample, lower microwave power is required for the overcoupled case.},

The impacts of oil with different fatty acid composition on free radicals were evaluated. An ESR study was performed to identify and quantify the formed radicals, along with the assessment of physicochemical parameters including peroxide value, oxidative stability, fatty acid composition, and volatile profile. Results showed an increase of formed free radicals in frying oils over frying time. Besides, frying oils with higher content of unsaturated fatty acids were more prone to be oxidized, as well as physicochemical parameters evidencing this phenomenon. Volatile compounds produced by β-scission homolytic cleavage of peroxide group during thermal oxidation in frying oils were detected by GC-MS/MS. Results implied major aldehyde volatile compounds were derived from hydroperoxide and oil with higher proportions of unsaturated fatty acids are more likely to produce volatile oxidation products. In order to compare the degree of lipid oxidation in deep-fried sunflower oil (high degree of unsaturation) and palm oil (high degree of saturation), the formed free radicals based on ESR, along with the assessment of physicochemical parameters including peroxide value, oxidative stability, fatty acid composition, and volatile profile to improve comprehensive assessment of degradation in oil with different fatty acid composition are investigated.},

The complementary parallel/perpendicular mode EPR, in situ 23Na NMR, 23Na/51V MAS NMR, and two-dimensional 23Na MQMAS NMR experiments substantiate that (i) both VIV and VIII are electrochemically active in this material, with the former transforming to VV, whereas the latter transforming to VIV; (ii) VIV continually converts to VV during the whole charge process, whereas VIII mostly reacts at the higher-potential charge plateau region; (iii) the Na+ extraction/intercalation process of Na3V2(PO4)2O1.6F1.4 is a widespread solid-solution mechanism; (iv) electronic spin hopping might occur locally between VIII and VV ions generated during the electrochemical reaction, resulting in the inconsecutive shift in 23Na resonance.

By measuring the transmittance of the positive electrolytes in VFB, the states of charge (SOC) of the positive electrolytes can be detected at very high resolution (better than 0.002\% in the SOC range from 98\% to 100\%), due to the nonlinear transmittance spectra caused by the interactions between V(IV) and V(V) ions. The intensity of the positive side reactions of a VFB can be rapidly measured by a few steps, attributing to the fact that the positive side reactions occur only during the high voltage charging process. The ratios of the positive side reactions at different charge currents and different flow rates are obtained while causing no damage to the battery. This optical detection method can rapidly determine the optimal parameters of the VFB system, providing new means for studying the electrochemical reactions in the VFB system and rapid test in industrial production of VFBs.},

In order to solve the complicated relations between the spectrum and the SOC of the VRB, the entire shape of the spectrum is utilized instead of the data at one wavelength. We experimentally demonstrate that SOCs from 0 to 100~\% can be monitored by comparing the transmission spectra of the positive electrolytes [V(IV)/V(V)] with the database, which is previously built by detecting standard samples. The method has potential ability to monitor the level of imbalances of the VRB, which is important for rebalancing the electrolyte and restoring the capacity loss of a VRB.},

Redox flow batteries (RFBs) with their high power density, high energy efficiency, scalability (up to MW and MWh), and safety features are one suitable option for integrating such energy sources and overcoming their intermittency. However, resource limitation and high system costs of current RFB technologies impede wide implementation. Here, a total organic aqueous redox flow battery (OARFB) is reported, using low-cost and sustainable methyl viologen (MV, anolyte) and 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (4-HO-TEMPO, catholyte), and benign NaCl supporting electrolyte. The electrochemical properties of the organic redox active materials are studied using cyclic voltammetry and rotating disk electrode voltammetry. The MV/4-HO-TEMPO ARFB has an exceptionally high cell voltage, 1.25 V. Prototypes of the organic ARFB can be operated at high current densities ranging from 20 to 100 mA cm2, and deliver stable capacity for 100 cycles with nearly 100\% Coulombic efficiency. The MV/4-HO-TEMPO ARFB displays attractive technical merits and thus represents a major advance in ARFBs.},

  abstract = {Experimental studies of spin-lattice relaxation in aqueous solutions of the free radical peroxylamine disulfonate ion, ON(SO3)−−2, have been made in fields near 30 oersteds. The continuous wave saturation technique was used to study the transition F=32, mF=−32→F=32, mF=−12, for which the frequency was 60 Mc sec−1. Because the hyperfine interaction of the unpaired electron with the N14 nucleus leads to six unequally spaced energy levels, a unique relaxation time cannot be defined. A general treatment of the saturation method leads to definition of the relaxation probability, which reduces for a system with two energy levels to the reciprocal of twice the relaxation time. The experimentally measured relaxation probability is found to be concentration independent below 0.005 molar in ON(SO3)−−2, approaching an asymptotic value of 2×106 sec−1. Experiment and theory both rule out as the source for this relaxation probability the interaction of the electron moment with the nuclear moments of the H2O solvent molecules, and theory also rules out the effect of the N14 electric quadrupole coupling to solvent motions; the latter can, in principle, effect electron relaxation because of the hyperfine coupling between the N14 nuclear spin and the electron spin. Estimates are made of the role played by spin-orbit coupling, and it appears probable that the observed relaxation involves this interaction. An interesting by-product of the analysis of the relaxation probability is the result that second order statistical processes, by which an electron spin is first carried with energy conservation to an excited Stark level before reaching the ground Stark level of opposite spin, may account for the observed relaxation. This process is somewhat similar to the Raman processes invoked by Van Vleck to explain relaxation in the alums, except that in Van Vleck's theory the intermediate excited Stark level is only virtually occupied, without energy conservation.},

The purpose of this study was to simplify manual quantitative EPR measurement. A suitable sample volume for achieving a stable EPR intensity was estimated. The effects of different solvents on the EPR sensitivity were compared. The stability and reproducibility of the EPR intensity of standard nitroxyl radical solutions were compared among different types of sample tubes. When the sample tubes, sample volumes, and/or solvents were the same, the EPR intensity was reproduced with an error of 2\% or less for μM samples. The quantified sample and the standard sample in the same solvent and the same volume drawn into the same sample tube was able to be directly compared. The standard sample for quantification should be measured just before or after every daily experiment.},

For this purpose, a BDPA-nitroxide biradical, employing a phosphodiester linkage, was synthesized. Contrary to what is commonly assumed, BDPA-derived radicals were observed to have limited stability. Hence, the effects of various factors on the stability of BDPA radicals were investigated. Solvent polarity was found to play a significant role on degradation; a polar BDPA radical was observed to degrade faster in a non-polar solvent, whereas non-polar radicals were more unstable in polar solvents. The rate of decomposition was found to increase non-linearly with increasing radical concentration; a 2-fold increase in concentration led to a 3-fold increase in the rate of degradation. Collectively, these results indicate that the dimerization is a significant degradation pathway for BDPA radicals and indeed, a dimer of one BDPA radical was detected by mass spectrometry.},

  abstract = {It is well established that the formation of radical species centered on various atoms is involved in the mechanism leading to the development of several diseases or to the appearance of deleterious effects of toxic molecules. The detection of free radical is possible using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and the spin trapping technique. The classical EPR spin-trapping technique can be considered as a “hypothesis-driven” approach because it requires an a priori assumption regarding the nature of the free radical in order to select the most appropriate spin-trap. We here describe a “data-driven” approach using EPR and a cocktail of spin-traps. The rationale for using this cocktail was that it would cover a wide range of biologically relevant free radicals and have a large range of hydrophilicity and lipophilicity in order to trap free radicals produced in different cellular compartments. As a proof-of-concept, we validated the ability of the system to measure a large variety of free radicals (O-, N-, C-, or S- centered) in well characterized conditions, and we illustrated the ability of the technique to unambiguously detect free radical production in cells exposed to chemicals known to be radical-mediated toxic agents.},

Currently, atomic layer deposition (ALD) is one of the most promising nanometric deposition technologies: it offers the possibility to obtain conformal coatings even on very complex tridimensional substrates, with a strict thickness tolerance. During an ALD cycle, only one molecular layer is deposited on the substrate surface, enabling the theoretical possibility to tailor the composition of the deposit up to molecular resolution. In the first part of this review, a brief history of ALD is presented to better understand the evolution of the technique during the past five decades; in the second part, a short description of the main ALD techniques is given, considering their main advantages and drawbacks. In the third part, a short review about ALD applications is presented, and in the fourth part the most useful and used instruments for the analysis and characterization of ALD are listed; some results are discussed and particular emphasis on the corrosion protection of different metallic alloys of common industrial interest is given.},

In the past, much attention was devoted to studying nitroxide EPR spectra and electron spin magnetization evolution under various experimental conditions. However, the dynamics of nitrogen nuclear spin has not been investigated in detail so far. In this work, we performed quantitative prediction and simulation of nitrogen nuclear spin magnetization evolution in several magnetic resonance experiments. Our research was focused on fast rotating nitroxide radicals in liquid solutions. We used a general approach allowing us to compute electron and nitrogen nuclear spin magnetization from the same time-dependent spin density matrix obtained by solving the Liouville/von Neumann equation. We investigated the nitrogen nuclear spin dynamics subjected to various radiofrequency magnetic fields. Furthermore, we predicted a large dynamic nuclear polarization of nitrogen upon nitroxide irradiation with microwaves and analyzed its effect on the nitroxide EPR saturation factor.},

In this paper, power saturation is shown to displace DISPA data symmetrically outside the reference circle. Adjacent peaks produce DISPA displacement that is detectable even for large peak separation (25 linewidths for a symmetrical doublet; 7 to 8 linewidths for the central line of a symmetrical triplet). Finally, a distribution in peak position is dominant over a distribution in linewidth in determining DISPA displacement. The DISPA plot shapes for these and 12 other line-broadening mechanisms are summarized in convenient reference form.},

Spectral diffusion induced by spin exchange is predicted to give rise to a large reduction in the overall spectral intensity, with relatively little change in the spectral lineshape. The effects at low exchange frequencies (of the order of or less than the intrinsic spin-lattice relaxation rate) are much greater than those on the saturation of the conventional EPR spectrum and are readily distinguishable from those of slow rotational diffusion due to the insensitivity of the spectral lineshape. The theoretical predictions are found to be in accord with experimental measurements on the spin-concentration dependence of the saturation-transfer EPR spectra of a spin-labeled phospholipid in model membrane systems.},

Among the different ES technologies, compressed air energy storage (CAES) can store tens to hundreds of MW of power capacity for long-term applications and utility-scale. The increasing need for large-scale ES has led to the rising interest and development of CAES projects. This paper presents a review of CAES facilities and projects worldwide and an overview of the ES regulatory framework and policies. It performs two benchmarking procedures: first, a benchmark of CAES worldwide, and second a benchmark of ES regulatory frameworks, policies, drivers and barriers. It tries to understand whether the development or cancellation of CAES projects globally is in any way related to the development of ES policies. This study addresses policy perspectives and specific ES regulatory framework recommendations, contributing to public policy design in the attempt to overcome the regulatory barriers to the ES sector and influencing the deployment of ES and, specifically, CAES. Removing current regulatory barriers and establishing new and broader policies are essential to provide ES and CAES technologies with the right opportunities to develop, enhance efficiency, increase operational experience, and reduce costs.},

Methods: The R1 dependence of the trityl probe Oxo71 on partial oxygen pressure (pO2) was assessed using single-point imaging mode of spatial encoding combined with rapid repetition, similar to T1-weighted MRI, for which R1 was determined from 22 repetition times ranging from 2.1 to 40.0 μs at 300 MHz. The pO2 maps of a phantom with 3 tubes containing 2 mM Oxo71 solutions equilibrated at 0\%, 2\%, and 5\% oxygen were determined by R1 and apparent spin–spin relaxation rate (R2*) simultaneously. Results: The pO2 maps derived from R1 and R2* agreed with the known pO2 levels in the tubes of Oxo71. However, the histograms of pO2 revealed that R1 offers better pO2 resolution than R2* in low pO2 regions. The SDs of pixels at 2\% pO2 (15.2 mmHg) were about 5 times lower in R1-based estimation than R2*-based estimation (mean±SD: 13.9±1.77 mmHg and 18.3±8.70 mmHg, respectively). The in vivo pO2 map obtained from R1-based assessment displayed a homogeneous profile in low pO2 regions in tumor xenografts, consistent with previous reports on R2*-based oximetric imaging. The scan time to obtain the R1 map can be significantly reduced using 3 repetition times ranging from 4.0 to 12.0 μs. Conclusion: Using the single-point imaging modality, R1-based oximetry imaging with useful spatial and oxygen resolutions for small animals was demonstrated.},

The observed dependence of the EPR signal intensity, Ipp, on the rotation angle has a general ovaloid shape with an eccentricity, ɛ, which varies linearly with the width, w, of the sample, ɛ=0.0246+0.0311×w, correlation, R=0.996, for samples with a width greater than 2mm but shows a positive deviation from linearity for the 1 and 2mm samples. The dependence of the Ipp value on the planar sample width, w, is non-linear for all polar-angle values investigated. These experimental observations are in a very good agreement with theoretical calculations in which the response is modelled using the Cassinian curves modified for planar sample geometry. Similar trends of the angular Ipp dependence were observed for any position of the planar sample as the centre was moved along the vertical x-axis of the cavity. In the longitudinal Ipp dependence for a planar sample whose length, L=30mm, is greater than that of the cavity, then (i) for the case where the whole cavity length is occupied by the sample a constant value for the Ipp (a plateau) is observed and (ii) for sample movement in and out of this plateau region the dependence varies according to the left and right halves of a modified “sine-squared” function. The variation in the signal amplitude along the cavity x-axis (longitudinal effect) can be calculated theoretically using a “sine-squared” curve, modified for an “over full-length cavity” planar sample. In general, the response of the cavity to a planar sample situated at any position on the common sample cavity x-axis can be represented as a product of a modified Cassinian curve and a modified “sine-squared” curve. The non-linear radial effect may give rise to serious sources of systematic error in quantitative EPR spectroscopy with planar sample geometry and shows that accurate and precise positioning of the sample in the microwave cavity is essential.},

  abstract = {The response of the cavity to the movement of cylindrical samples with internal diameters from 0.7 to 4 mm and lengths from 5 to 50 mm along thex-axis of the Bruker double TE104 and single TE102 rectangular cavity has been analyzed. Independently of sample internal diameter, the experimentally observed dependences of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) signal intensity versus sample position in the cavity showed the following: (i) a sharp maximum for sample lengths from 5 to 20 mm; (ii) a “plateau”, over which the signal intensity remained constant within experimental errors of 0.47–1.16\%, for lengths from 30 to 40 mm; and (iii) a “sloping plateau” region, which could be approximated by the linear function (correlationr = 0.96–0.98) for the 50 mm sample. Theoretical predictions of the experimental dependences of the signal intensity versus sample position in the cavity were calculated with the “modified” and “revised” sine-squared function, and the correlation between observed and theoretically computed dependences is very good. Additionally, the experimental dependence of the signal intensity versus the sample internal diameter and length for cylindrical samples situated at the position in the cavity at which the signal intensity was a maximum was likewise numerically approximated by the surface fitting with the Lorentzian cumulative additive function (correlationr = 0.999). The experimental dependence of the signal intensity versus the sample internal diameter for the given sample length is nonlinear. The samples with internal diameters of 0.7 and 1 mm gave the total maximum of signal intensity for the 40 mm sample, however, the samples with internal diameters of 2, 3 and 4 mm gave the total maximal value of signal intensity, which was identical for both the 30 and 40 mm samples. The experimental dependence of the EPR signal intensity versus the sample volume clearly showed that the samples with identical volumes, however, with different shapes, can give significantly different signal intensities (with differences ca. 200–400\%). Then, the comparison of cylindrical samples with identical volumes but different shapes may be a serious source of significant errors in quantitative EPR spectroscopy. Cylindrical samples to be compared should be of identical shape. Accurate and precise positioning of each sample in the microwave cavity is essential.},

T1 values at 4.2~K are in the µs range which is orders of magnitude faster than for 3d transition metals. Phase memory times, Tm, are less than 500~ns, which is short relative to values observed for 3d transition metals and organic radicals at 4~K. Tm is longer in the oxalate lattice which is attributed to the lower proton concentration in oxalate than in the organic solvent, which decreases nuclear spin diffusion. The rigidity of the crystalline lattice also may contribute to longer Tm.},

To acquire high resolution spectra the signal bandwidth must be less than the resonator bandwidth. Signal bandwidth is inversely proportional to linewidth and proportional to scan rate. Resonator bandwidth is inversely proportional to resonator Q. Proper selection of scan rate and resonator Q is needed to achieve resolution of closely-spaced narrow EPR lines.},

  abstract = {An X-band (ca. 9-10 GHz) continuous wave saturation recovery spectrometer to measure electron spin-lattice relaxation (T1) was designed around an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG). The AWG is the microwave source and is used for timing of microwave pulses, generation of control signals, and digitizer triggering. Use of the AWG substantially simplifies the hardware in the bridge relative to that in conventional spectrometers and decreases the footprint. The bridge includes selectable paths with different power amplifications to permit experiments requiring hundreds of milliwatts to fractions of nanowatts for the pump and observe periods. The signal is detected with either a single or quadrature-output double balanced mixer. The system can operate with reflection or crossed-loop resonators. The source noise from the AWG was decreased by addition of a Wenzel high-stability clock. The source is sufficiently stable that automatic frequency control is not needed. The spectrometer was tested with samples that contained 1 × 1015 to 8 × 1017 spins and have T1 between a few hundred ns and hundreds of μs. Excellent signal-to-noise ratio was obtained with acquisition times of 2–90 s. Signal-to-noise performance is similar to that of a conventional saturation recovery spectrometer with a solid-state source. The stability and data reproducibility are better than with conventional sources. With replacement of frequency-sensitive components, this spectrometer can be used to perform saturation recovery measurements at any frequency within the range of the AWG.},

In this project the performance of the VOFC over a range of temperatures and using different types of membranes and air electrode assemblies was evaluated. Despite early problems with the membrane electrode assemblies that saw separation of the membrane due to swelling and expansion during hydration, with improved fabrication techniques, this problem was minimized and it was possible to operate a 5-cell VOFC system for a total of over 100~h without any deterioration in its performance.},

Analytic full wave solutions in the presence of sample and wall losses have been obtained and numerically evaluated. Observation of the predicted fields led to a classification of three distinct types of sample loss mechanisms, which, in turn inspired sample designs that minimize each loss type. The resulting EPR signal enhancement is due to the presence and centering of a tangential electric field node within each individual sample region. Samples that saturate with the available RF magnetic field and those that do not are considered. Signal enhancement appears in both types. These observations, done for the TE102 mode, carry over to the uniform field (UF) modes, a relatively new class of microwave cavities for use in EPR spectroscopy developed in this laboratory. Rectangular UF modes have an RF magnetic field magnitude that is uniform in a plane. Based on this analysis, a practical multiple flat-cell design is proposed.},

Fluorene is quenched by the enone functionality on acrylates and methacrylates, but is not quenched after the carbon-carbon double bond in this group is broken by incorporation into the polymer backbone. Ethyl (2-fluorenyl)methacrylate was used as a self-quenching comonomer during the 2,2'-pazo bis(2-methylpropionitrile)-initiated free-radical copolymerization of methyl methacrylate at 60°C. The fluorescence intensity increases by 60\% up to the onset of the gel effect (defined as the sudden increase in the temperature profile). The system shows sensitivity well into the glassy state, with fluorescence increasing more than two orders of magnitude from the beginning of the reaction. This sensitivity is compared with that of two free-volume-dependent probes, 1,3-bis(1-pyrene)propane and dimethylaminobenzylidenemalononitrile, and to fluorene. The temperature profile of the test-tube-scale reaction was used as an internal reference for characterizing the sensitivity of the probes with respect to the gel effect region. © 1994 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {The advantages of rapid-scan EPR relative to CW and pulse techniques for samples with long longitudinal relaxation time T1 (Ns0 defects in diamond, N@C60, and amorphous hydrogenated silicon), heterogeneous samples (crystalline 1:1 α,γ-bisdiphenylene-β-phenylallyl (BDPA):benzene), lossy samples (aqueous nitroxyl radicals), and transient radicals (5-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (BMPO)-superoxide adduct) were studied. For samples with long relaxation times, CW (continuous wave) EPR is challenging due to power saturation and distortions from passage effects. In rapid-scan EPR, the field is swept through resonance in a time that is short relative to T2. In rapid-scan EPR, the magnetic field is on resonance for a short time relative to CW EPR. Because of this, the energy absorbed by the spins, for the same microwave B1, is less than in conventional CW spectra, and the signal does not saturate as readily. For samples with long electron relaxation times, pulse techniques can also be challenging, particularly if T2 is long and T2* is short. Rapid-scan EPR is a powerful alternative to CW and pulse EPR because it is a straight-forward technique that does not require the high power of pulse EPR. For the samples studied, improvements in signal-to-noise ranging from factors of 10 to 250 were observed. Rapid-scan can also be used to extract relaxation information from a sample. The rapid-scan spectra for lithium phthalocyanine (LiPc) and 15N-PDT (4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetra-perdeuteromethyl-piperidinyl-15N-oxyl-d16) were simulated to determine T2. The extraction of T2 from the rapid-scan spectra of BDPA was also attempted. Through our difficulty in simulating the rapid-scan spectra of BDPA, we realized that commercial BDPA was not a homogeneous sample. The experiments studying BDPA demonstrated that rapid-scan experiments can give insight into the relaxation of a sample that might not otherwise be evident with conventional CW EPR. Finally, rapid-scan EPR at X-band was applied to spin trapping experiments. Superoxide was generated by the reaction of xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine and trapped with BMPO. Spin trapping with 5-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (BMPO) to form BMPO-OOH adduct converts the short-lived superoxide into a more stable spin adduct. The detection limit for spin-trapped superoxide was compared between CW and rapid-scan EPR. The signal-to-noise ratio was more than 40 times greater for rapid-scan than for CW EPR. We also demonstrated detection of superoxide produced by Enterococcus faecalis at rates that are too low for detection by CW EPR.},

To detect the state of the biological water, sensing elements based on LC-oscillators operating at 120 and 60 GHz are realized using the 65 nm CMOS process. The sizes of the sensing elements are significantly smaller than the wavelengths of the operating frequencies, therefore 2-D arrays can be implemented in a chip. The trial chip enables us to obtain spatial distributions of the targets. In this paper, the cultivated bacterial colony growth is monitored and other biosensing applications are explained, which showcase possibilities for using the biosensor IC.},

The advantages and application of strong excitation are discussed. Two 17 GHz transmission-type, stripline resonators were designed, simulated and fabricated. Scattering parameter measurements were carried out and quality factor were measured to be around 160 and 85. Simulation results of the microwave’s magnetic field distribution are also presented. To determine the excitation field at the sample, nutation experiments were carried out and power dependence were measured using two organic samples at room temperature. The highest recorded Rabi frequency was rated at 210 MHz with an input power of about 1 W, which corresponds to a π/2 pulse of about 1.2 ns. We report on the design, fabrication, and characterization of an integrated detector for electron spin resonance spectroscopy operating at 27 GHz. The microsystem, consisting of an LC-oscillator and a frequency division module, is integrated onto a single silicon chip using a conventional complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor technology. The achieved room temperature spin sensitivity is about 108 spins/G Hz1/2, with a sensitive volume of about (100 μm)3. Operation at 77 K is also demonstrated. A novel X-band CW EPR imaging has been developed using magnetic-field-gradient (MFG) spinning to obtain spatial distributions of electron paramagnetic species. Spinning MFG EPR imaging for 65 projection spectra required just 55 s while conventional imaging took 11 min 40 s, that is, the acquisition time for the new system is one order of magnitude shorter than that for conventional EPR imaging. Spinning MFG EPR imaging allows one to measure reconstructed images in an interactive manner where resolution and condition can be changed quickly.},

Especially for highly reactive cyanoacrylates, better known as super glues, the adhesion mechanism is poorly understood because, among other things, the characterization of the interface is difficult. The aim of this work is to evaluate methods to produce nm-thin, homogeneous films of cyanoacrylate to enable spectroscopic analysis of the interface in the future. Two deposition techniques, thermal evaporation and spin coating, of ethyl-cyanoacrylate, are compared. Thickness and composition of the cured films are investigated by atomic force microscopy, laser scanning microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Thermal evaporation in ultra-high vacuum leads to cluster-like depositions and is therefore not suitable for interface analysis. Spin coating is strongly dependent on solvent and concentration. While the solvent tetrahydrofuran leads to porous and inhomogeneous films, spin coating with anisole as solvent provides homogeneous films of cyanoacrylate with a thickness of only 4 nm. This allows surface-sensitive analytical methods to access the interface and possible interactions can be characterized in-situ.},

  abstract = {Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht Ladungstransport- und -rekombinationsprozesse in hydrogenisiertem amorphen Silizium (a-Si:H). Als Prototyp eines ungeordneten Halbleiters sind die strukturellen und elektronischen Eigenschaften von a-Si:H maßgeblich durch das Fehlen kristalliner Ordnung bestimmt. Dies führt zur Ausbildung lokalisierter Zustände, die als Elektronenfallen und Rekombinationszentren den Ladungstransport stark beeinträchtigen können. Um die Auswirkung struktureller Unordnung auf elektronische Materialeigenschaften im Detail zu verstehen, ist es unablässig, Transportmechanismen auf nanoskopischer Ebene zu untersuchen. Die dafür ideale Methode ist elektrisch detektierte Magnetresonanz (EDMR). Diese auf Elektronenspinresonanz (EPR, engl.: electron paramagnetic resonance) beruhende Spektroskopiemethode vereint die Möglichkeit, paramagnetische Zentren zu identifizieren und auf atomarer Ebene zu charakterisieren, mit elektrischer Detektion. Dadurch misst EDMR gezielt paramagnetische Zustände, die an elektronischen Transport- oder Rekombinationsprozessen beteiligt sind. Da EDMR zudem hochempfindlich ist, können Experimente sogar an vollständig prozessierten optoelektronischen Bauelementen, wie etwa Solarzellen, durchgeführt werden. Sowohl EDMR als auch EPR wurden in dieser Arbeit eingesetzt, um direkten experimentellen Zugang zum Ladungstrennungsmechanismus lichtinduzierter Elektronen-Loch-Paare in a-Si:H zu erhalten. Erstmalig konnte so eindeutig die Existenz von stark gekoppelten, lokalisierten Exzitonen nachgewiesen und ihr Einfluss auf elektronische Transporteigenschaften untersucht werden. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass Exzitonen eine Schlüsselrolle in der Trennung lichtinduzierter Ladungsträger einnehmen, die für die Funktionsweise von Solarzellen von zentraler Bedeutung ist. Im Rahmen dieser Arbeit wurden außerdem Methodiken entwickelt, die auch für die Untersuchung anderer Halbleitermaterialen angewendet werden können, die spinabhängige Leitfähigkeit aufweisen. Insbesondere wird eine neue EDMR-Detektionsmethode präsentiert, die eine Identifizierung verschiedener paramagnetischer Zentren auf Basis des zugrundeliegenden Spinzustands ermöglicht. Diese Arbeit steht im Kontext einer umfangreichen Forschungshistorie an a-Si:H. Frühere Ergebnisse konnten auf Basis dieser Arbeit neu bewertet werden, wobei Antworten auf lange bestehende Fragestellungen in Bezug auf die nanoskopische Beschaffenheit elektronischer Transportprozesse in a-Si:H gefunden werden konnten. Da viele strukturelle und elektronische Eigenschaften von a-Si:H ungeordnete Festkörper im Allgemeinen betreffen, sind die Ergebnisse nicht auf technische Anwendungen von a-Si:H beschränkt, sondern auch von grundlegendem wissenschaftlichen Interesse für das Verständnis elektronischer Prozesse in amorphen Halbleitern.},

  abstract = {Paramagnetic point defects in silicon provide qubits that could open up pathways towards silicon-technology based, low-cost, room-temperature (RT) quantum sensing. The silicon dangling bond (db) is a natural candidate, given its sub-nanometer localization and direct involvement in spin-dependent charge-carrier recombination, allowing for electrical spin readout. In crystalline silicon, however, rapid loss of db spin-coherence at RT due to free-electron trapping, strongly limits quantum applications. In this work, by combining density-functional theory and multifrequency (100 MHz-263 GHz) pulsed electrically detected magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we show that upon electron capture, dbs in a hydrogenated amorphous silicon matrix form metastable spin pairs in a well-defined quasi two-dimensional (2D) configuration. Although highly localized, these entangled spin pairs exhibit nearly vanishing intrinsic dipolar and exchange coupling. The formation of this magic-angle-like configuration involves a {$>$}0.3 eV energy relaxation of a trapped electron, stabilizing the pair. This extends RT spin coherence times into the microsecond range in silicon required for a future spin-based quantum sensing technology.},

  abstract = {The contributions to the spin resonance absorption lines observed in amorphous silicon and germanium are discussed in terms of the different relaxation processes. It is shown that besides a g-value distribution, hyperfine interaction contributes significantly. Dipolar and anisotropic exchange interactions are shown to be of minor importance except at the highest spin densities. The temperature-dependent increase in linewidth is explained by a modulation of the spin-orbit interaction owing to the motion of the carriers. A semiclassical model is used to show that the distribution of spin-flip times given by a sequence of consecutive hops in the framework of variable-range hopping can lead to the observed changes in linewidth and lineshape. Some exchange interaction is required to narrow the lines and to transfer the hopping-induced spin-flip rate to the spins far below the Fermi level. An anti-ferromagnetic exchange of the order of 1 K as reported recently, however does not seem likely in the light of the observed spin-resonance lineshapes.},

A general expression is derived for the magnetoresistance. The magnetoresistance is deduced to be the result of the modification of the spin-flip relaxation time by the external magnetic field. Explicit formulae are derived within the variable range hopping theory of Mott and the spin relaxation model described previously by the present authors.

The formalism is derived on the basis of strong electric fields but they allow the possibility of describing the low-field ohmic region by using a simple scaling argument. Stark localisation in narrow energy bands implies that the transport phenomena are a superposition of phonon-assisted hopping and intra-band tunnelling. The transport equations and transition rates are derived and discussed in relation to experimental results. In addition they also consider the influence of an external magnetic field both parallel and perpendicular to the layers. The influence of disorder is considered and it is found that it can considerably modify the nature of the physical effects predicted on the basis of the 'pure' eigenstates. Recent experiments on magneto-transport perpendicular to the layers are discussed in the light of this theoretical formalism.},

The reliability of the choice to measure ROS production rate in human capillary blood rather than in plasma was tested (step I). A significant () linear relationship between EPR data collected on capillary blood versus venous blood (), plasma (), and erythrocytes () was found. Then (step II) ROS production changes of various subjects’ categories, young versus old and healthy versus pathological at rest condition, were found significantly different (range 0.0001–0.05 level). The comparison of the results with antioxidant capacity and oxidative damage biomarkers concentrations showed that all changes indicating increased oxidative stress are directly related to ROS production increase. Therefore, the adopted method may be an automated technique for a lot of routine in clinical trials.},

Generally, it is not correct to compare directly the intensities of the signals from two samples that contain different paramagnetic centers, or are different in matrix material, dimensions, or position in the cavity. It is necessary to evaluate the resulting systematic errors and correct them. The paper is devoted to the analysis of the following sources of errors which frequently occur in such situations: nonuniformity of the cavity fields; different extent of microwave field perturbation by samples with different dielectric constants; inequality of the transition probabilities corresponding to the used spectral lines of the samples under comparison. Theoretical and semiempirical calculations enable one to determine the magnitudes of the errors from these sources and to obtain the appropriate correction factors in many specific cases.},

This transformation is a generalization of the Lorentz transformation and is obtained in two steps. First, the Minkowski metric is transformed under an intermediate coordinate transformation to obtain a new set of noninertial metric coefficients in which one can easily identify the Thomas precession, as well as the expression for the acceleration of the moving frame with respect to the instantaneous rest frame in terms of the acceleration as seen from a stationary inertial frame. Second, a rotation of axes is performed to absorb the Thomas precession and to add an ordinary spatial rotation. The coordinate transformation obtained by combining these effects is nonlinear, since certain terms involve time integrals, and leads to the appropriate space‐time metric for an accelerated, rotating frame of reference. It is shown that the usual forms of the Lorentz transformation are contained as special cases of this result.},

The use of this technique has been underexploited because of the opposite requirements they impose on the conventional setup. In this work, a versatile electrode with commercially available indium tin oxide on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was constructed for the first time which can fit inside commonly used flat cells. It allows reproducible electrodeposition of catalytic material combined with sensitive radical detection, owing to its large surface area and minimal disruption to the resonator's Q-factor. Moreover, with a resistivity of 8–10 Ω sq−1, the surface potential of the thin semiconductor electrode within the resonator was well-controlled, allowing targeted radical production.},

This volume covers the range of disciplines required for understanding polarized targets, focusing in particular on the theoretical and technical developments made in dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP), NMR polarization measurement, high-power refrigeration, and magnet technology. Beyond particle and nuclear physics experiments, dynamically polarized nuclei have been used for experiments involving structural studies of biomolecules by neutron scattering and by NMR spectroscopy. Emerging applications in MRI are also benefiting from the sensitivity and contrast enhancements made possible by DNP or other hyperpolarization techniques. Topics are introduced theoretically using language and terminology suitable for scientists and advanced students from a range of disciplines, making this an accessible resource to this interdisciplinary field.},

In an optimal situation, a balanced-distribution exists between oxidants and antioxidants among wines intrinsic/extrinsic metabolites. Based on the kinetic study of POBN-1-hydroxyethyl spin adduct (POBN-1-HER) formation in wines initiated via the Fenton reaction, a novel tool based on EPR spin trapping methodology was developed to quantify wines resistance against oxidation. Antioxidant capacities of wines were evaluated according to POBN-1-HER maximum signal intensity (Imax POBN-1-HER) and rate formation (rPOBN-1-HER) kinetic parameters. Low Imax POBN-1-HER and rPOBN-1-HER values suggest that endogenous antioxidants in wine are able to quench a substantial amount of radicals capable to take part in deleterious oxidative reactions. This will be very valuable in understanding aging potential and will provide an avenue to better control the process by knowing how it might be possible to change wines resistance against oxidation.},

The size, morphology, and elemental composition of the particles were quantified with a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray instrument (SEM–EDX). The particles appeared in various shapes, and their size mainly varied from 0.4 to 10μm, with the mean diameters of 0.5, 1.5, and 1.0μm before, during, and after the dust storm, respectively. The critical size of the mineral particles settling on the surface in the current case was about 0.3–0.4μm before the dust storm and about 0.5–0.7μm during the dust storm. Particles that appeared in high concentration but were smaller than the critical size deposited onto the surface at a small number flux. The elements Al, Si and Mg were frequently detected in all samples, indicating the dominance of mineral particles. The frequency of Al in particles collected before the dust storm was significantly lower than for those collected during and after the dust storm. The frequencies of Cl and Fe did not show obvious changes, while those of S, K and Ca decreased after the dust arrival. These results indicate that the dust particles deposited onto the surface were less influenced by anthropogenic pollutants in terms of particle number.},

  abstract = {Automation has become an essential component of modern scientific instruments which often capture large amounts of complex dynamic data. Algorithms are developed to read multiple sensors in parallel with data acquisition and to adjust instrumental parameters on the fly. Decisions are made on a time scale unattainable to the human operator. In addition to speed, automation reduces human error, improves the reproducibility of experiments, and improves the reliability of acquired data. An automatic digital control (ADiC) was developed to reliably sustain critical coupling of a resonator over a wide range of time-varying loading conditions. The ADiC uses the computational power of a microcontroller that directly communicates with all system components independent of a personal computer (PC). The PC initiates resonator tuning and coupling by sending a command to MC via serial port. After receiving the command, ADiC establishes critical coupling conditions within approximately 5~ms. A printed circuit board resonator was designed to permit digital control. The performance of the resonator together with the ADiC was evaluated by varying the resonator loading from empty to heavily loaded. For the loading, samples containing aqueous sodium chloride that strongly absorb electromagnetic waves were used. A previously reported rapid scan (RS) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) imaging instrument was upgraded by the incorporation of ADiC. RS spectra and an in vivo image of oxygen in a mouse tumor model have been acquired using the upgraded system. ADiC robustly sustained critical coupling of the resonator to the transmission line during these measurements. The design implemented in this study can be used in slow-scan and pulsed EPR with modifications.},

The great advantage of using a field effect transistor (FET) for the marginal oscillator section is that it has a much higher input impedance than a bipolar transistor. The original design has been used successfully as the basis of third and fourth year undergraduate n.m.r. experiments and has proved to be quite satisfactory over a frequency range of 0.5 MHz to 20 MHz (corresponding approximately to 10-2 Wbm-2 to 0.5 Wbm-2 for a proton resonance).},

To analyze the effect of water crossover and the resultant electrolyte imbalance issue in the vanadium redox flow battery, herein we newly develop a water transport model and incorporate it into our previously developed 3D vanadium redox flow battery model. The model rigorously accounts for water production/consumption by the redox reaction of VO2+/VO2 and side reactions as well as various mechanisms of water crossover through the membrane arising from diffusion, electro-osmotic drag (EOD), and vanadium crossover. The numerical model is successfully validated against in situ data collected during experiments in which the electrolyte volumes and cell voltages are measured during charge–discharge cycles carried out under various current densities. The detailed simulation results clearly elucidate water crossover behaviors at different stages of charging and discharging, and further reveal the individual contributions of water crossover mechanisms to the overall electrolyte imbalance between the negative and positive sides of the VRFB system.},

The magnetic field homogeneity in the BLGR can be improved with a bridge. The optimum angle for such bridges can be found by measuring the RF magnetic field. In this study, the RF magnetic field was measured for BLGRs 70 mm in diameter, with a resonance frequency of 302 ± 5 MHz.

The progress of preconditioning is tracked with UV-vis spectroscopy by 3D printed micro flow cuvettes. Influence of flow rate, reactor internal resistance, and presence of side reactions in the preconditioning process are studied. Optimal flow rate ratio between negative and positive electrolytes is determined and significant performance improvements achieved by operating at lower flow rates are obtained. Influence of reactor internal resistance, which is directly related with the maximum power density, is evaluated demonstrating that operating at a high-power density can be a source of inefficiency due to the presence of side reactions. Finally, presence of side reactions is evaluated through a dual measurement of electrolytes concentrations in both negative and positive side, and it is demonstrated to be a cause for charge imbalance between the two half-cells. This work lays a solid foundation for the successful implementation of a charge-discharge cycle in MVMRFBs operating in recirculation mode.},

The following were the relative concentrations of the radicals under different conditions:\, (1) Two oils, produced by continuous centrifugation, aged for 1 year, showed a 25−30\% increase in the radicals compared to nonaged oils; 1-year-old oil, produced by pressure, did not differ from the nonaged oil. (2) Radical production was markedly reduced by N2 bubbling; it was increased by heating, whereas it showed a biphasic pattern by air bubbling over time. (3) Radical concentration as a function of the UV irradiation time increased up to a maximum, after which it decreased and finally remained constant. The phenolic and oxygen contents were related to the radical content. This study demonstrates that the EPR technique is suitably applied to the detection of free radicals in olive oil and that storage, handling, and stress conditions of the oils significantly influence the radical concentration.

The parameters Aiso, giso, Azz, and gxx of MTSSL were found to be sensitive to changes in solvent properties, where A-values increased and g-values decreased due to increased solvent polarity or proticity. A linear correlation was found for the isotropic (giso, Aiso) and anisotropic (gxx, Azz) parameters, respectively. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the same parameters were performed for a model spin label with the possibility to vary the dielectric constant (ε) of the medium and the number of hydrogen bonds formed with the nitroxide oxygen. From a qualitative analysis of experimental and calculated results, it was possible to specify the causes of the parameter shifts in more detail. In the “apolar region” (ε {$<$} 25), the sensitivity of Aiso and Azz to ε is large. However, in the “polar region” (ε {$>$} 25), the sensitivity to ε is small, and the shifts in Aiso and Azz are mainly determined by the proticity of the solvent. Methanol was found to form ∼1 and water ∼2 hydrogen bonds to the nitroxide on average. The DFT method determined the shifts in giso and gxx due to hydrogen bonding more accurately compared with the restricted open-shell Hartree−Fock method. The anisotropic spin label-solvent data can be used in the interpretation of rigid-limit data from spin-labeled proteins to gain further insight in local environmental properties.},

  abstract = {We aim to improve the accuracy of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)-based in vivo tooth dosimetry using the relationship between tooth geometry and radiation-induced signals (RIS). A homebuilt EPR spectrometer at L-band frequency of 1.15 GHz originally designed for non-invasive and in vivo measurements of intact teeth was used to measure the RIS of extracted human teeth. Twenty human central incisors were scanned by microCT and irradiated by 220 kVp x-rays. The RISs of the samples were measured by the EPR spectrometer as well as simulated by using the finite element analysis of the electromagnetic field. A linear relationship between simulated RISs and tooth geometric dimensions, such as enamel area, enamel volume, and labial enamel volume, was confirmed. The dose sensitivity was quantified as a slope of the calibration curve (i.e., RIS vs. dose) for each tooth sample. The linear regression of these dose sensitivities was established for each of three tooth geometric dimensions. Based on these findings, a method for the geometry correction was developed by use of expected dose sensitivity of a certain tooth for one of the tooth geometric dimensions. Using upper incisors, the mean absolute deviation (MAD) without correction was 1.48 Gy from an estimated dose of 10 Gy; however, the MAD corrected by enamel area, volume, and labial volume was reduced to 1.04 Gy, 0.77 Gy, and 0.83 Gy, respectively. In general, the method corrected by enamel volume showed the best accuracy in this study. This homebuilt EPR spectrometer for the purpose of non-invasive and in vivo tooth dosimetry was successfully tested for achieving measurements in situ. We demonstrated that the developed correction method could reduce dosimetric uncertainties resulting from the variations in tooth geometric dimensions.},

  abstract = {Organic matter (OM) sources and transfers are critical questions at the crossroad of ecology, hydrology and paleoenvironmental studies in karst environments. Recently chemical or isotopic characterisations of these organic matters have demonstrated their diversity in karst water and speleothems. However, knowledge of their origin and transfer from soil needs to be improved especially in karst environments where a mosaic of soils occurs. Here we investigate the applicability of the Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) signature of OM to seek different soil fingerprints in speleothems. The positions and the shapes of semiquinone-type radical’s EPR lines are considered as a robust signature of the organic matter through the different compartment of karst ecosystems. We demonstrate that the combination of EPR lines simulation constitutes a fingerprint that discriminates folic Leptosol developed on limestone outcrops from eutric Cambisols located in the dolines and topographical depressions. We also report the conservation of the thinner OM EPR lines after a water extraction of the organic matter from soils. Finally, OM EPR signatures were detected in two different speleothems sampled near each other: a stalagmite and a subaqueous flowstone. An unexpected two-orders-of-magnitude discrepancy between the free radical concentrations of the subaqueous flowstone and the soils on one hand, and the low free radical concentration of the stalagmite samples on the other, was ascribed to the kinetics of conformational changes in OM occurring during their transfer through karst either in fast or in slow water pathways. A folic Leptosol fingerprint was found in stalagmite and conversely, an eutric Cambisol fingerprint was found in the flowstone sample. This unexpected difference between the EPR signatures of the flowstone sample and stalagmite sample was ascribed to the masking of the Leptosol EPR signature (due to the low concentrations of free radicals) in the case of the flowstone sample and to the fact that the EPR signature of the stalagmite sample clearly shows the Leptosol is the sole source of the OM. Finally, the folic Leptosol fingerprint remains steady over the last four centuries covered by the stalagmite demonstrating that the source of the OM is stable over the growth period strengthening the interest of OM entrapped in speleothem for paleoenvironment studies.},

A symmetric coupling circuit was used to achieve better shielding and minimize radiation. The frequency of the resonator can be easily adjusted by trimming the area of the capacitive foil bridge, which overlaps the gap in the cylindrical loop. The working frequency set was 2.2 GHz and the unloaded Q was 720. The B1 field of this resonator was measured and spatially mapped by three-dimensional EPR imaging.

Increased sample volume and loading capability were achieved by employing a multi-loop three-dimensional surface coil structure. Symmetrical design of the resonator with coupling to each loop resulted in high homogeneity of RF magnetic field. Parallel loops were coupled to the feeder cable via balancing circuitry containing varactor diodes for electronic coupling and tuning over a wide range of loading conditions. Manually adjusted high Q trimmer capacitors were used for initial tuning with subsequent tuning electronically controlled using varactor diodes. This design provides transparency and homogeneity of magnetic field modulation in the sample volume, while matching components are shielded to minimize interference with modulation and ambient RF fields. It can accommodate lossy samples up to 90\% of its aperture with high homogeneity of RF and modulation magnetic fields and can function as a surface loop or a slice volume resonator. Along with an outer coaxial NMR surface coil, the SSCR enabled EPR/NMR co-imaging of paramagnetic probes in living rats to a depth of 20 mm.},

Here C is a constant which depends on the experimental conditions, |Vij|2 the square of the transition matrix element, Q0 the unloaded cavity Q factor, η the sample filling factor, σv, the linewidth (in frequency units), and f the lineshape function. The above equation describes both frequency-swept EPR, where ν0 is fixed and ν is varied, and field-swept EPR detected at a constant microwave frequency (ν = νc where ν0 is the proper field-dependent variable. The Aasa and Vanngard 1/g factor (J. Magn. Reson. 19, 308 (1975)) is required whenever the above equation is written in terms of field variables as has been a common practice for field-swept EPR. Linewidth anisotropy in field-swept EPR is found to arise in some cases simply as a consequence of the g anisotropy; true tinewidth anisotropy is a property of σν. Asymmetric field-swept lineshapes are predicted for g-strain broadening; i.e., when σν, depends linearly upon the magnetic field. Implications of these ideas for powder spectral simulations are described.},

  abstract = {A new method is proposed that restores the battery energy and capacity of a Vanadium Redox Flow Battery, by counteracting the charge imbalance caused by air-oxidation and hydrogen evolution in the negative electrolyte. The process makes use of a regeneration system specifically designed and successfully tested. This system is built around an electrolysis cell, that is called “regeneration cell”, where an electro-reduction reaction of V(V) is coupled with an oxygen evolution reaction catalyzed by a Ti-IrO2 electrode. The rebalancing of three different unbalanced electrolytes was tested: V3.55+, V3.60+ and V3.65+, namely: 45\% V(III)/55\% V(IV), 40\% V(III)/60\% V(IV) and 35\% V(III)/65\% V(IV) respectively. The behavior of the VRFB cell during the rebalancing process was investigated both numerically and experimentally. An end-point strategy for the rebalancing process without additional sensors has been developed by using of a specific mathematical model capable of simulating the current response and concentrations profile during the rebalancing process. This strategy allowed to improve the performance of the rebalancing process. After rebalancing, the resulting electrolyte oxidation states were respectively: V3.483+, V3.482+, V3.484+. Since a perfectly balanced electrolyte is V3.50+ (50\% V(III), 50\% (VIV) such results demonstrated that the electrolyte imbalance was drastically reduced and the rebalancing process was successful.},

The measured saturation factor gives for F centers in KCl a spin-lattice relaxation time of 2.5×10−5 sec at room temperature. The observed saturation behavior in which only the absorption saturates is in marked disagreement with the Kramers-Kronig relations. However it is shown, that the Kramers-Kronig relations are not applicable to saturated systems. Expressions which avoid the use of these relations are presented for saturable systems.},

  abstract = {Electrolyte imbalance is the main cause of capacity loss in vanadium redox flow batteries. It has been widely reported that imbalance caused by vanadium crossover can be readily recovered by remixing the electrolytes, while imbalance caused by a net oxidation of the electrolyte can only be reverted by means of more complex chemical or electrochemical methods. At the moment, however, the joint effect of both types of imbalances on the battery capacity is still not well understood. To overcome this limitation, generalised State of Charge and State of Health indicators that consider both types of imbalances are derived in this work. Subsequently, a thorough analysis on how the battery capacity depends on electrolyte imbalance is performed. As a result of this analysis, two specific outcomes are highlighted. Firstly, it is shown that standard electrolyte remixing may be counterproductive under certain imbalance conditions, further reducing the battery capacity instead of augmenting it. Secondly, it is demonstrated that most of the capacity loss caused by oxidation can be mitigated by inducing an optimal mass imbalance in the system. Consequently, a systematic procedure to track this optimum is proposed and validated through computer simulation.},

By multivariate curve resolution with alternating least-squares fitting (MCR-ALS) of simultaneously recorded XAS and UV-Vis data sets, it was found that an initially formed (bpy)(NMI)CuI- complex (bpy=2,2′-bipyridine, NMI=N-methylimidazole ) is converted to two different CuII species, a mononuclear (bpy)(NMI)(CH3CN)CuII-OOH species detectable by EPR and ESI-MS, and an EPR-silent dinuclear (CH3CN)(bpy)(NMI)CuII(μ-OH)2⋅CuII (bpy)(NMI) complex. The latter is cleaved in the further course of reaction into (bpy)(NMI)(HOO)CuII-TEMPO monomers that are also EPR-silent due to dipolar interaction with bound TEMPO. Both Cu monomers and the Cu dimer are catalytically active in the initial phase of the reaction, yet the dimer is definitely not a major active species nor a resting state since it is irreversibly cleaved in the course of the reaction while catalytic activity is maintained. Gradual formation of non-reducible CuII leads to slight deactivation at extended reaction times.},

While recent studies have shown that a higher vanadium concentration than that initially proposed might be feasible, further reliable solubility data for the various vanadium ions is required if the electrolyte composition is to be properly optimized. This study describes the results of a solubility study of vanadyl sulfate in sulfuric acid. VOSO4 is the species which exists in the discharged positive half-cell of the vanadium redox cell. The solubility data have been generated in sulfuric acid concentrations that range from 0 to 9 mol/l and at temperatures between 10 and 50°C. The solubility of VOSO4 is found to decrease continuously with increasing H2SO4 concentration and decreasing temperature. At 20°C, the solubility of VOSO4 in distilled water is 3.280 mol/l whereas in 9 M H2SO4 it is 0.260 mol/l. The drop in solubility with increasing H2SO4 concentration is significant and is more pronounced at lower concentrations. A multivariable solubility prediction model has been developed as a function of temperature and total sulfate/bisulfate (SO42− and HSO4−) concentration using the extended Debye–Huckel functional form. The average absolute deviation of the predicted solubility values from experimental data is 4.5\% with a maximum deviation of about 12\% over the abovementioned temperature and sulfuric acid concentration range. When solubility data in the more useful H2SO4 concentration range of 3–7 M is considered, the solubility correlation improved with an average absolute deviation of only 3.0\% and a maximum deviation of about 7\%.},

  abstract = {Conventional modulation spectrum, MS, in continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance, CW-EPR, is produced by applying longitudinal radiofrequency (RF) fields with the frequencies, ωrf, which exceeds the linewidth, 2πδ, of a single spectral line given in frequency units. The second longitudinal RF field with frequency, ωrf2, is employed to produce double modulation spectrum, DMS. In this work DMS are presented as a specific type of MS which can be produced from an ordinary homogenous line. The numerical simulations of DMS in the limit of low power saturation relied on the recently introduced multi-photon transitions formalism which includes one microwave photon in combination with an arbitrary number of radiofrequency photons. It is shown that DMS of an inhomogeneous line exhibits similar basic structure as MS and exhibits sideband peaks at multiples of basic radiofrequencies. Linewidths of these peaks are significantly narrower (cca. two – three orders of magnitude) than the inhomogeneous linewidth and can be correlated with the underlying homogeneous linewidth components on the basis of characteristic spin-lattice, T1, and spin-spin, T2, relaxation times. The capability to extract T1 and T2 from DMS was tested on the well-known E’ defect in irradiated vitreous SiO2. The obtained results revealed the impact of “rapid passage” effect on DMS in improving the detection sensitivity of DMS in the study of paramagnetic centers with long relaxation times. Therefore, double modulation method can be considered as a complementary method for studying inhomegeneous broadening in the EPR spectra.},

In contrast to a previous structure determination, two crystallographically independent cobalt(II) centers have been found to be present. In the antiferromagnetic state, below the critical temperature (Tc=3.94 K) and critical field (Hc=290 Oe), slow relaxations of the ferromagnetic chains are observed. They originate mainly from defects in the magnetic structure, which has been elucidated by micromagnetic Monte Carlo simulations and ac measurements using pristine and defect samples. The energy barriers of the relaxations are Δτ1=44.9(5) K and Δτ2=26.0(7) K for long and short spin chains, respectively. The spin excitation energy, measured by using frequency-domain EPR spectroscopy, is 19.1 cm−1 and shifts 0.1 cm−1 due to the magnetic ordering. Ab initio calculations revealed easy-axis anisotropy for both CoII centers, and also an exchange anisotropy Jxx/Jzz of 0.21. The XXZ anisotropic Heisenberg model (solved by using the density renormalization matrix group technique) was used to reconcile the specific heat, susceptibility, and EPR data.},

Dosimetry was performed by ESR spectroscopy of long-lived radiation-induced radicals that could be measured in the heart tablets of the victim. The concentration of the free radicals proved, by proper calibration, to be proportional to dose. Procedures and dose results are reported; comparison is made with data from literature dealing with the same subject and also using TL as well as ESR.

Based on the results, an empirical equation was developed to anticipate the minimum temperature depending on the operating conditions. First, temperature distribution in each electrode was examined in charge and discharge process. Temperature increased at discharge process, but decreased of 2.11~°C compared to outside temperature at charge process. Therefore, precipitation can be found during charge process. Next, effect of operating conditions on the minimum temperature is analyzed. When current density is 100~mA/cm2, the minimum temperature decreased of 2.5~°C compared to outside temperature due to large amount of endothermic reaction. On the other hand, as flow rate increases, minimum temperature increased. Because high flow rate promotes heat transfer between the cell and electrolyte. The effect of cell design also considered. As active area increases, the minimum temperature decreased 2.12~°C compared with outside temperature because more endothermic reaction occurs in large area. The effects of porosity, however, is negligible because of interaction between changes in flow configuration and endothermic reactions. Finally, an empirical equation is developed to know the proper operating conditions for given cell design to prevent precipitation due to cold outside temperature.},

  abstract = {A new crossed-loop resonator (CLR) structure is described that uses two orthogonal resonators to isolate the EPR signal from the microwave source. Resonators of this type are usually referred to as bimodal, which is descriptive of cavity or distributed element resonators. However, it is more useful to think of the new resonator as two virtually independent lumped-element resonators that have a common sample volume where the loops of the two resonators meet orthogonally. The first resonator excites the spins, and the second resonator (or resonant section of the CLR) acts like an antenna that detects only the signal caused by the spin system. In this manner, the very phenomenom that is being studied is used to separate the desired EPR signal from the microwave source and performs the function of the circulator. The signal coupled into the second resonator is due to the spin system. The phase noise of the source is reflected from the first resonator back toward the source and is efficiently isolated from the second resonator and the EPR signal. This resonator structure eliminates the need for the circulator, simplifies the spectrometer circuit, virtually eliminates source phase noise in the detected signal, and allows dispersion spectra to be measured with the same high signal-to-noise (S/N) as absorption spectra. In addition, for pulse experiments, this resonator greatly decreases the dead time of the instrument and allows measurement of a portion of the signal previously inaccessible with other resonators. The CLR is rugged, easy to tune, does not have to be critically coupled, and is easily adjusted to maintain source isolation when the sample is changed.},

  abstract = {The scope of application of ESR spectroscopy has greatly expanded with the advent of its widespread use in radiation exposure dating around 1980 and its use in retrospective dosimetry since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. Few fields of study are of such breadth that they span topics as diverse as dating of human origins, volcanic activity, cave deposits and earthquakes, while also providing prognoses for radiation accident victims. Between 1945 and 1975 ESR was mainly used to define the nature of paramagnetic defects in crystalline and amorphous materials, which laid the foundation for its use in applied areas in Quaternary geology, archaeometry and accident dosimetry. This review chronicles the development of the use of ESR in applied science since 1975, with particular emphasis on the state of the art in the period 1987–1997. The first part of the review focuses mainly on the range of applications for datable materials: tooth enamel (Section 2), calcite (Section 3) and quartz (Sections 4–9), while the second part comprises the areas of retrospective dosimetry (Section 10) and new applications (Section 11). The review concludes (Appendix A) with an introduction to the physical basis and assumptions involved in ESR dating, and compilations of valuable reference works for students and workers in this field.},

  abstract = {In oxidative phosphorylation, complex I (NADH:quinone oxidoreductase) couples electron transfer to proton translocation across an energy-transducing membrane. Complex I contains a flavin mononucleotide to oxidize NADH, and an unusually long series of iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters, in several subunits, to transfer the electrons to quinone. Understanding coupled electron transfer in complex I requires a detailed knowledge of the properties of individual clusters and of the cluster ensemble, and so it requires the correlation of spectroscopic and structural data: This has proved a challenging task. EPR studies on complex I from Bos taurus have established that EPR signals N1b, N2 and N3 arise, respectively, from the 2Fe cluster in the 75 kDa subunit, and from 4Fe clusters in the PSST and 51 kDa subunits (positions 2, 7, and 1 along the seven-cluster chain extending from the flavin). The other clusters have either evaded detection or definitive signal assignments have not been established. Here, we combine double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy on B. taurus complex I with the structure of the hydrophilic domain of Thermus thermophilus complex I. By considering the magnetic moments of the clusters and the orientation selectivity of the DEER experiment explicitly, signal N4 is assigned to the first 4Fe cluster in the TYKY subunit (position 5), and N5 to the all-cysteine ligated 4Fe cluster in the 75 kDa subunit (position 3). The implications of our assignment for the mechanisms of electron transfer and energy transduction by complex I are discussed.},

  abstract = {Manifestations of the spin coherence transfer induced by the exchange and dipole–dipole interactions between spin probes in dilute solutions in the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra have been studied. The perturbation theory of manifestations of the spin coherence transfer in the EPR spectra of nitroxide free radicals elaborated by one of the authors Salikhov (Applied Magnetic Resonance 38:237–256, 2010) has been generalized with allowance for the super hyperfine structure of the EPR spectra. For 14N nitroxide radicals, the total EPR spectrum was presented as a sum of three independent components in the case of slow and intermediate spin coherence transfer rates. The shapes of these components were found. The side components of the EPR spectrum contain the absorption and dispersion contributions and, as a result, have the asymmetric (mixed) shapes. These asymmetric components can be presented as J~=~Jabsorption~±~p Jdispersion. The p value is found for the arbitrary super hyperfine structure of the spectrum. In the slow and intermediate spin coherence transfer rate regime, the parameter p is independent of the super hyperfine interactions in the nitroxide radicals, but the shapes of Jabsorption and Jdispersion terms depend on the super hyperfine structure of the nitrogen components of the nitroxide EPR spectrum and on the spin coherence transfer rate. It is confirmed theoretically that a good strategy to evaluate the spin coherence transfer rate from the EPR spectra is using the dispersion contribution to the shape of the EPR spectra of nitroxide free radicals. An algorithm is suggested and tested for determining the spin coherence transfer and spin decoherence rates.},

  abstract = {We have analyzed the effect of saturation of the EPR spectrum for the model situation when a set of resonance frequencies of spin packets is described by a Gaussian distribution and spectral diffusion, which is a random process without correlation, exists. We have obtained the form of the spectrum for arbitrary values of magnetic–resonant parameters: relaxation times for the longitudinal and transverse components of the magnetization vector of the system, the spectral diffusion rate, the dispersion of the Gaussian distribution of resonance frequency, and the magnetic induction of the microwave field. We have derived an analytic expression for the saturation curve of the EPR spectrum. Detailed analysis of the dependence of the spectrum saturation curve on the spin system parameters is performed for the optimal case when the microwave field frequency coincides with the average frequency of the Gaussian distribution for resonance frequencies. The value of the microwave field induction at which the peak of the saturation curve is attained has been determined for arbitrary values of the paramagnetic relaxation time, spectral diffusion rate, and dispersion of the Gaussian spin frequency distribution. We have formulated the algorithm for determining the spin–lattice relaxation time using the experimentally determined microwave field induction for which the saturation curve passes through the peak. It should be noted that numerical calculations have been performed for parameters typical of EPR spectroscopy. The general analytic expression derived for the shape of the spectrum in the saturation conditions and qualitative conclusions concerning the effect of spectral diffusion on the saturation of stationary spectra obtained in this study can also be used in other fields of spectroscopy.},

  abstract = {Handheld pipettes are invaluable to scientists in labs across the globe. Due to high inaccuracies at volumes of less than 1 [mu]L, a nanoliter pipette could truly change the way people research. This experimental nanoliter pipette uses a regulating CAM mechanism and a diaphragm to displace small amounts of fluid. The CAM mechanism has the ability to be adjusted to different steps, each of which controls the amount of working fluid to be displaced in a sealed chamber. In response to this, the diaphragm displaces a smaller volumetric amount of fluid outside the chamber. A deamplification ratio is defined by the ratio of the volume displaced by the diaphragm to the volume displaced by the CAM mechanism. The deamplification ratio is adjustable by changing the setting of the variable CAM mechanism or exchanging different tip assemblies which hold different sized diaphragms. In all, this nanoliter pipette enables measuring and dispensing of very small volumes of liquid, ranging from I nL to 1[mu] L, and can expand the tools of every lab researcher internationally.},

Biopsies from three different body sites of 71 human volunteers were obtained, and thickness of the stratum corneum and cellular epidermis was measured microscopically using a preparation technique preventing tissue damage. Multiple regressions analysis was used to evaluate the effect of the various factors independently of each other. Mean (SD) thickness of the stratum corneum was 18.3 (4.9) microm at the dorsal aspect of the forearm, 11.0 (2.2) microm at the shoulder and 14.9 (3.4) microm at the buttock. Corresponding values for the cellular epidermis were 56.6 (11.5) microm, 70.3 (13.6) microm and 81.5 (15.7) microm, respectively. Body site largely explains the variation in epidermal thickness, but also a significant individual variation was observed. Thickness of the stratum corneum correlated positively to pigmentation (p = 0.0008) and negatively to the number of years of smoking (p {$<$} 0.0001). Thickness of the cellular epidermis correlated positively to blood content (P = 0.028) and was greater in males than in females (P {$<$} 0.0001). Epidermal thickness was not correlated to age or skin type.},

To perform the sought optimization, we need to either exploit “constant adiabaticity” chirps or utilize the gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE) method: in these ways, the Δ(t) profiles are evaluated, which allow one to minimize the duration of the chirps. Arbitrary waveform generator-based ESR (AWG-ESR) enables us to apply versatile MW-shaped pulses and to control dynamics of the spin systems under study. Spin dynamics for spin inversion by the shaped pulses were observed. Comparison of different frequency sweeps applied to both a homogeneous ESR signal and a spin packet of inhomogeneously broadened ESR signals indicates that the duration of the adiabatic sweeps can be significantly reduced.},

Relaxation rates at 34 GHz were measured between 80 and 298 K. Room-temperature relaxation rates also were measured at 250 MHz, 1.9 GHz, and 2.76 GHz. The temperature dependences of linewidths and spin susceptibilities are characteristic of 1-D organic conductors. The ratio of populations of localized and delocalized electrons varies with sample preparation. For a single needle between 15 and about 200 K, 1/T2 is higher for the parallel orientation, but 1/T1 is higher for the perpendicular orientation, consistent with predictions based on dipolar interactions. Between about 60 and 150 K, which is the temperature regime in which spin susceptibility is changing rapidly with temperature, 1/T1 exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on temperature and is lower at 34 GHz than at 9.5 GHz. In other organic conductors, this dependence has been attributed to a bottleneck mechanism of relaxation. At higher temperatures, 1/T1 becomes less orientation-dependent. At room temperature, T1 increases rapidly between 250 MHz (3.0 μs) and 2.76 GHz (6.3 μs) and then shows less frequency dependence up to 34 GHz (9.8 μs). The relaxation rate near room temperature might have a substantial contribution from spin hopping perpendicular to the stacking axis of the molecules.},

Relaxation rates for polar nitroxyls also were measured in glassy sorbitol. Dependence on T where V eff is effective molecular volume and γ is a material-specific parameter, was used to compare processes. Values of V eff were determined based on molecular libration in glassy sucrose octaacetate (γ = 3.5), tumbling in viscous decalin at 233 K (γ = 4.7), or tumbling in heavy mineral oil (γ = 6.0). For nitroxyl relaxation there is a master curve: log(1/T 1) vs log( T) (γ = 0.89). The similarity of the values of γ for the Raman process and for the additional process that contributes at higher temperatures, and the absence of frequency dependence between X- and Q-band, support assignment of this additional process as a local mode. For these radicals the contributions from the local mode and the Raman process are correlated and follow trends in spin–orbit coupling. The temperature dependence of spin echo dephasing in sucrose octaacetate is dominated by rotation of methyl groups and by a motional process analogous to the Raman process.},

  abstract = {Introduction: Tumor hypoxia confers both a poor prognosis and increased resistance to oncologic therapies, and therefore, hypoxia modification with reliable oxygen profiling during anticancer treatment is desirable. The OxyChip is an implantable oxygen sensor that can detect tumor oxygen levels using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry. We report initial safety and feasibility outcomes after OxyChip implantation in a first-in-humans clinical trial (NCT02706197, www.clinicaltrials.gov).Materials and Methods: Twenty-four patients were enrolled. Eligible patients had a tumor ≤ 3 cm from the skin surface with planned surgical resection as part of standard-of-care therapy. Most patients had a squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (33\%) or a breast malignancy (33\%). After an initial cohort of six patients who received surgery alone, eligibility was expanded to patients receiving either chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to surgical resection. The OxyChip was implanted into the tumor using an 18-G needle; a subset of patients had ultrasound-guided implantation. Electron paramagnetic resonance oximetry was carried out using a custom-built clinical EPR scanner. Patients were evaluated for associated toxicity using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE); evaluations started immediately after OxyChip placement, occurred during every EPR oximetry measurement, and continued periodically after removal. The OxyChip was removed during standard-of-care surgery, and pathologic analysis of the tissue surrounding the OxyChip was performed.Results: Eighteen patients received surgery alone, while five underwent chemotherapy and one underwent radiotherapy prior to surgery. No unanticipated serious adverse device events occurred. The maximum severity of any adverse event as graded by the CTCAE was 1 (least severe), and all were related to events typically associated with implantation. After surgical resection, 45\% of the patients had no histopathologic findings specifically associated with the OxyChip. All tissue pathology was “anticipated” excepting a patient with greater than expected inflammatory findings, which was assessed to be related to the tumor as opposed to the OxyChip.Conclusion: This report of the first-in-humans trial of OxyChip implantation and EPR oximetry demonstrated no significant clinical pathology or unanticipated serious adverse device events. Use of the OxyChip in the clinic was thus safe and feasible.},

The spectrometer design is based on a heterodyne microwave bridge using an X-band intermediate frequency (IF), a hybrid magnet system, a variable-temperature, top-loading TeraFlex probehead with a TE011 cavity as well as the ELEXSYS-line digital electronics and the Xepr software package. The W-band bridge can be driven by a CW- or pulse-IF unit and delivers a microwave power of 5 mW at 94 GHz. In pulse mode the power is sufficient for a π/2 pulse of 100 ns at a resonatorQ-value of 3000. The magnet system consists of a 6 T split-coil superconducting magnet and a water-cooled room-temperature coil. The main coil can be swept over the full range from 0 to 6 T. The room-temperature coil has a 800 G sweep range around the persistent field of the main magnet. The ENDOR probe features a tuned circuit for1H nuclei allowing an RF π-pulse of 8 𝜇s with a 200 W amplifier. A broad-band setup is used for other nuclei. The E680 FT-EPR system utilizes the PatternJet pulse programmer and the SpecJet high-speed transient signal averager. The concerted action of these two devices results in a pulse EPR sensitivity equal or higher than in CW-EPR. Selected examples indicating the performance of the 94 GHz CW/FT-EPR and ENDOR systems are shown.},

  abstract = {Savitzky–Golay (SG) filtering, based on local least-squares fitting of the data by polynomials, is a popular method for smoothing data and calculations of derivatives of noisy data. At frequencies above the cutoff, SG filters have poor noise suppression; this unnecessarily reduces the signal-to-noise ratio, especially when calculating derivatives of the data. In addition, SG filtering near the boundaries of the data range is prone to artifacts, which are especially strong when using SG filters for calculating derivatives of the data. We show how these disadvantages can be avoided while keeping the advantageous properties of SG filters. We present two classes of finite impulse response (FIR) filters with substantially improved frequency response: (i) SG filters with fitting weights in the shape of a window function and (ii) convolution kernels based on the sinc function with a Gaussian-like window function and additional corrections for improving the frequency response in the passband (modified sinc kernel). Compared with standard SG filters, the only price to pay for the improvement is a moderate increase in the kernel size. Smoothing at the boundaries of the data can be improved with a non-FIR method, the Whittaker–Henderson smoother, or by linear extrapolation of the data, followed by convolution with a modified sinc kernel, and we show that the latter is preferable in most cases. We provide computer programs and equations for the smoothing parameters of these smoothers when used as plug-in replacements for SG filters and describe how to choose smoothing parameters to preserve peak heights in spectra.},

The kinetics of the growth and decay of these long-lived, trapped band-tail carriers consists of very fast components (τ {$<$} ms) and very long components (τ {$>$} h). Optical quenching of these long-lived carriers is not efficient at quenching energies of 0.6 eV. Afler removal of these long-lived band tail carriers by annealing at about 250 K we find that the total production of silicon dangling bonds at 65 K after 10 h of illumination is about a factor of five less than at 340 K. The dangling bond production resulting from 10 h of illumination is well fit to an underlying mechanism that, if thermally activated, exhibits an activation energy of approximately 10 meV.},

Below about 150 K the measurement of optically induced silicon dangling bonds is masked by long-lived, band-tail carriers that accumulate with time t as t1/3. It is known that these long-lived carriers can be quenched by infrared light. However, optically, it is not possible to completely remove them. The production rate for optically induced silicon dangling bonds decreases with decreasing temperature. Below about 100 K degradation is at most half as efficient as at room temperature and is nearly temperature independent below approximately 100 K. Additionally, defects created by 10 h of irradiation below 100 K almost entirely anneal at T≅300K. It is common procedure to anneal a-Si:H samples for 30 min at 175 °C to restore the as-deposited defect density. However, by repeatedly performing degradation and annealing cycles we find that a small fraction of defects is not restored by annealing at 175 °C and that these defects slowly accumulate with degradation. For defects created at all temperatures we find the same ESR fingerprint, indicating that only one dominant type of defect is created, presumably the silicon dangling bond, and we conclude that different, temperature-dependent stabilization processes must exist. These results lead to new constraints for models that attempt to explain the Staebler-Wronski effect.},

  abstract = {Large-scale energy storage has become the main bottleneck for increasing the percentage of renewable energy in our electricity grids. Redox flow batteries are considered to be among the best options for electricity storage in the megawatt range and large demonstration systems have already been installed. Although the full technological potential of these systems has not been reached yet, currently the main problem hindering more widespread commercialization is the high cost of redox flow batteries. Nafion, as the preferred membrane material, is responsible for about 11 \% of the overall cost of a 1 MW/8 MWh system. Therefore, in recent years two main membrane-related research threads have emerged: 1) chemical and physical modification of Nafion membranes to optimize their properties with regard to vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) application; and 2) replacement of the Nafion membranes with different, less expensive materials. This review summarizes the underlying basic scientific issues associated with membrane use in VRFBs and presents an overview of membrane-related research approaches aimed at improving the efficiency of VRFBs and making the technology cost-competitive. Promising research strategies and materials are identified and suggestions are provided on how materials issues could be overcome.},

  abstract = {Electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR) is a spectroscopic technique that provides information about the physical properties of materials through the detection of variations in conductivity induced by spin-dependent processes. EDMR has been widely applied to investigate thin-film semiconductor materials in which the presence of defects can induce the current limiting processes. Conventional EDMR measurements are performed on samples with a special geometry that allows the use of a typical electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) resonator. For such measurements, it is of utmost importance that the geometry of the sample under assessment does not influence the results of the experiment. Here, we present a single-board EPR spectrometer using a chip-integrated, voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) array as a planar microwave source, whose geometry optimally matches that of a standard EDMR sample, and which greatly facilitates electrical interfacing to the device under assessment. The probehead combined an ultrasensitive transimpedance amplifier (TIA) with a twelve-coil array, VCO-based, single-board EPR spectrometer to permit EDMR-on-a-Chip (EDMRoC) investigations. EDMRoC measurements were performed at room temperature on a thin-film hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) pin solar cell under dark and forward bias conditions, and the recombination current driven by the a-Si:H dangling bonds (db) was detected. These experiments serve as a proof of concept for a new generation of small and versatile spectrometers that allow in situ and operando EDMR experiments.},

  abstract = {The development of surface-immobilized molecular redox catalysts is an emerging research field with promising applications in sustainable chemistry. In electrocatalysis, paramagnetic species are often key intermediates in the mechanistic cycle but are inherently difficult to detect and follow by conventional in situ techniques. We report a new method, operando film-electrochemical electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (FE-EPR), which enables mechanistic studies of surface-immobilized electrocatalysts. This technique enables radicals formed during redox reactions to be followed in real time under flow conditions, at room temperature and in aqueous solution. Detailed insight into surface-immobilized catalysts, as exemplified here through alcohol oxidation catalysis by a surface-immobilized nitroxide, is possible by detecting active-site paramagnetic species sensitively and quantitatively operando, thereby enabling resolution of the reaction kinetics. Our finding that the surface electron-transfer rate, which is of the same order of magnitude as the rate of catalysis (accessible from operando FE-EPR), limits catalytic efficiency has implications for the future design of better surface-immobilized catalysts.},

  abstract = {Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is an essential tool to investigate the effects of ionizing radiation, which is routinely administered for reducing contaminations and waste in food products and cosmetics as well as for sterilization in industry and medicine. In materials research, EPR methods are not only employed as a spectroscopic method of structural investigations, but also have been employed for detection of changes in electronic structure due to radiation damage from high energy X-rays, for example, to monitor radical formation inside biomolecules caused by X-ray irradiation at carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen K-edges at synchrotron facilities. Here a compact EPR spectrometer, based on EPR-on-a-chip (EPRoC) sensor and a portable electromagnet, has been developed as a solution for monitoring radiation damage of samples during their investigation by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at synchrotron facilities. A portable electromagnet with a soft iron core and forced air temperature stabilization was constructed as the source of the external magnetic field. The sweep range of magnetic field inside the most homogeneous region of the portable electromagnet is 12–290~mT. The compact spectrometer performance was evaluated by placing the EPRoC sensor inside either a commercial electromagnet or the portable electromagnet to record the EPR spectrum of tempol, irradiated alanine, and dilithium phthalocyanine (Li2Pc). The potential performance of the portable spectrometer for the detection of radiation damage in organic compounds and transition metal-containing catalysts during XAS measurements in both fluorescence and transmission modes was calculated with promising implications for measurements after implementation in a synchrotron-based XAS spectrometer.},

Very little is known about the elemental composition and possible sources of fine aerosol particles from Mediterranean megacities. Fine aerosol particles were collected at a residential-industrial area in Greater Cairo, Egypt, during the period from October 2010 to May 2011. The elemental compositions of the collected samples were quantified by using a homemade energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence spectrometer, whereas black carbon was quantified by a black smoke detector. Fifteen elements have been quantified. Of these constituents, Ca, C, Cl, S, and Fe had the highest concentrations: greater than 1~µg~m−3. The overall mean mass concentration of the collected samples equals 70~µg~m−3; this value exceeds the European Union annual Air Quality Standard levels. The individual elemental concentrations of the fine particles were found to be dominated by elements linked to mineral dust. Most of the monthly variations of elemental concentrations can be attributed to seasonal meteorological conditions. Other possible sources were vehicle-exhaust and industrial activities. The results pinpoint the problem of identifying different sources when one source, in this case, the nearby deserts, is dominant. The results from this study contribute to the growing knowledge of concentrations, composition, and possible sources of ambient fine particulate matter.},

The samples exhibit a singlet Lorentzian line with g = 2.0026 ± 0.0002 and ΔHpp = 0.124 ± 0.005 mT which may be attributed to holes localized at rapidly rotating C60 molecules, i.e. C60+ free radicals. The bulk density of the C60+ radicals in the as-grown samples depends on the conditions of the sample preparation and reaches 1 spin per 10 000 molecules for fast-grown films. Annealing at 570 K leads to a rapid decrease in that density. Irradiation of the C60 thin films by visible and UV light leads to a significant increase in the number of the same C60+ radicals. The total number of photoinduced defects depends on the light intensity and time of exposure. The irradiation by visible light is active only in the presence of oxygen whereas the UV irradiation acts also when the sample is kept in an inert atmosphere. At ambient conditions the C60+ radicals are metastable with life time of several months.},

We evaluated the abilities of four spin traps in trapping cell-generated O2-: 5-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (BMPO), 2-diethoxyphosphoryl-2-phenethyl-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole N-oxide (DEPPEPO), 5-diethoxyphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DEPMPO), and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO). Optimal experimental conditions for obtaining maximal signal intensity of O2- adduct in a cellular system were first studied. The maximal intensities of BMPO, DEPMPO, and DMPO adducts were similar while DEPPEPO did not trap cell-generated O2- induced by 1,6-benzo[a]pyrene quinone in a human mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-10A). BMPO and DEPMPO adducts were more stable, considering the stability of their maximal signal, than DMPO adduct in the tested cellular systems. In addition, we observed that O2- spin adducts were reduced to their corresponding hydroxyl adducts in the cellular system. The selection of optimal spin trap in trapping cell-generated O2- is discussed.},

While a low concentration of the vanadium ion is required for measuring the UV–Vis spectroscopy, the practical VRFB system has a high concentration of vanadium ions in both positive and negative electrolytes. Furthermore, a reference blank solution for the UV–Vis spectrum can complicate the UV–Vis equipment connected with the VRFB system. To address this complication, quartz cuvette windows with notably thin path lengths below 0.1\,mm and a concept of difference absorbance (Adiff) are introduced for the SOC monitoring system to be simplified. Through these methods, we experimentally demonstrate that the SOC monitoring based on Adiff can be easily achieved in the anolyte (linear fitting), rather than the catholyte (parabolic fitting), in which the calibrations of Adiff vs. SOC were performed at the UV–Vis peaks of 410\,nm in the anode side and 575\,nm in the cathode side, respectively. The UV–Vis in-operando mode has the potential ability to monitor the real-time SOC in VRFB, thereby contributing to the simple VRFB-SOC monitoring system.},

The 2D spectral-spatial image demonstration was performed at 250\,MHz, with samples in sealed tubes of various sizes arranged in a 3D-printed plastic holder. Maximum gradients of 10\,G/cm gave a spatial resolution of about 0.1\,mm for the narrow trityl and LiPc signals and about 1\,mm for the nitroxide. The importance of proper selection of resonator bandwidth and scan rate for obtaining accurate linewidth information is demonstrated for a case in which the phantom is composed of species with signal linewidths and relaxation times that differ by more than a factor of 10.},

  abstract = {Responding to rapid growth of the renewable energy applications, it is crucial to develop low cost and high efficient large-scale energy storage systems in order to smooth out the intermittency of the renewable energy resources. As one of the most promising large-scale energy storage systems, vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) has attracted great attention in recent times. Membrane is one of the key components of VRFB which not only affects the whole cyclability performance but also determines the economic viability of the system. The membrane separates the positive and negative half-cells and prevents the cross-mixing of vanadium ions while providing required ionic conductivity. The ideal membrane should have good ionic exchange capacity; high ionic conductivity, low water uptake, swelling ratio, area electrical resistance and vanadium and other poly-halide ions permeability; and good chemical stability, as well as low cost. Numerous efforts have been spent on the development of different types of membranes, including different functional groups ion exchange membrane and non-ionic porous membrane. This paper reviews the research on membranes in VRFB system, including the properties, development of traditional commercial membranes as well as recently developed membranes. It explores various methods of fabrication of the membrane products which have received relatively little attention. A detailed summary table of the new membranes with their properties, fabrication and costs is provided to serve as a reference guide for researchers and industrialists interested in VRFB system building and dynamic modelling set. Subsequently, the challenges and future directions of membrane research are examined.},

The resonant structure consists of two commercially available X-band DRs that are separated by a Rexolite spacer and resonate in the fundamental TE01δ mode. The separator between the DRs is used to tune the resonator to the desired frequency and, by appropriately drilled sample holes, to provide access for longitudinal samples, notably capillaries containing oriented, spin-labeled muscle fibers. In contrast to the topologically similar cylindrical TE011 cavity, the DR-based structure has distinct microwave properties that favor its use for parallel orientation of lossy aqueous samples. For perpendicular orientation of a dilute (6.25 μM) aqueous solution of IASL spin label, the S/N ratio was at least one order of magnitude better for the side-access DR-based structure than for a standard TE102 cavity. EPR spectra acquired for maleimide spin-labeled myosin filaments also revealed ca. 10 times better S/N ratio than those obtained with a standard TE102 cavity. For the side-access DR with sample capillaries oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the external magnetic field, the Q- and filling factors are in good agreement with the theoretical estimates derived from the distribution of magnetic (H1) and electric (E1) components.},

  abstract = {Inspired by the considerable success of cryogenically cooled NMR cryoprobes, we present an upgraded X-band EPR probehead, equipped with a cryogenic low-noise preamplifier. Our setup suppresses source noise, can handle the high microwave powers typical in X-band pulsed EPR, and is compatible with the convenient resonator coupling and sample access found on commercially available spectrometers. Our approach allows standard pulsed and continuous-wave EPR experiments to be performed at X-band frequency with significantly increased sensitivity compared to the unmodified setup. The probehead demonstrates a voltage signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement by a factor close to 8× at a temperature of 6~K, and remains close to 2× at room temperature. By further suppressing room-temperature noise at the expense of reduced microwave power (and thus minimum π-pulse length), the factor of SNR improvement approaches 15 at 6~K, corresponding to an impressive 200-fold reduction in EPR measurement time. We reveal the full potential of this probehead by demonstrating such SNR improvements using a suite of typical hyperfine and dipolar spectroscopy experiments on exemplary samples.},

  abstract = {After over 25 years, the use of electron spin resonance (ESR) is well-established in dating sites of geological, paleontological and archaeological interest. Like any scientific technique, there have been changes in understanding and in methodology. Improvements have not, however, changed the observation that external dose calculations are still a significant source of uncertainty in ages. Examples from Europe, Africa and the Americans illustrate this point. For Pradayrol Cave (France), the occupation age, 330~ka, is unchallenged, making this the oldest known Neanderthal site in France. For Roc de Marsal, also in France, on the other hand, discrepancies between TL and sedimentary dose rates imply substantial differences in interpretation. In the Western Egyptian Desert, where artifacts and datable material are not well-correlated, the dating results show consistency with expectations based on global climate change, even in deflated sites. Climate change is also the question in geological studies in the Bahamas where, despite concerns about cosmic dose history, ESR dates confirm other evidence for sea level changes. We show that an uncertain age is not the same as an impossible one.},

In this paper concentration profiles of the different vanadium ions have been modeled as a function of time under different charge and discharge currents in order to predict expected capacity loss over extended charge–discharge cycling. In the case of cation exchange membranes, a build up in total vanadium ion concentration in the positive half-cell is predicted, in agreement with observed trends in laboratory prototype VRB systems. Effects of factors other than diffusion are discussed in detail, along with electrolyte maintenance strategies to restore capacity during long-term VRB operation.},

  abstract = {The vanadium redox flow battery pioneered by Skyllas-Kazacos et al. at the University of New South Wales (UNSW) is currently considered as one of the few electrochemical energy storage systems suitable for use in the large-scale utility applications that are emerging in response to the increasing global implementation of renewable energy technologies for the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. While the original all-vanadium redox flow battery (G1 VRF) has already been successfully implemented in a wide range of stationary field trials in Japan, U.S.A., Austria, Italy and Australia, further cost reduction has been needed for its widespread market up-take. In this paper, up to 80\% efficiency is reported for the latest 5–10 kW G1 VRF battery stack employing low-cost stack materials that are expected to achieve the necessary cost structure for the majority of stationary energy storage applications. While the G1 VRF battery has shown high efficiencies and excellent cycle life, however, its low energy density has restricted its use in mobile applications. The new Generation 2 vanadium bromide redox battery (G2 V/Br) patented by UNSW in 2001 has been shown to potentially double the energy density of the G1 VRF battery, allowing mobile applications to be considered. In this paper, the performance of the G2 V/Br is presented at a range of temperatures and the use of complexing agents is shown to successfully bind any bromine produced during charging to prevent the formation of bromine vapours.

This capacity loss can be corrected by either simple remixing of the two solutions, or by chemical or electrochemical rebalancing. In order to develop automated electrolyte management systems therefore, the state-of-charge of each half-cell electrolyte needs to be known. In this study, two state-of-charge monitoring methods are investigated for use in the vanadium redox flow battery. The first method utilizes conductivity measurements to independently measure the state-of-charge of each half-cell electrolyte. The second method is based on spectrophotometric principles and uses the different colours of the charged and discharged anolyte and catholyte to monitor system balance and state-of charge of each half-cell of the VRB during operation.},

Vanadium exists in several oxidation states with significantly different half-cell potentials that can produce practical cell voltages. It is thus possible to use the same element in both half-cells and thereby eliminate problems of cross-contamination inherent in all other flow battery chemistries. Electrolyte properties vary with supporting electrolyte composition, state-of-charge, and temperature and this will impact on the characteristics, behavior, and performance of the vanadium battery in practical applications.

  abstract = {Using deprotonated forms of tetradentate phenol amine ligands 2-((((1-methylbenzimidazol-2-yl)methyl)(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)amino)methyl)phenol (HL1), dinuclear vanadium(IV,V) complex of composition [(L1)2(VIVO)(µ-O)(VVO)](ClO4) (1) was synthesized and characterized by X–ray crystallography, UV–Vis, EPR and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Direct current (DC) variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements on polycrystalline sample of 1 were carried out in the temperature range 1.8–300 K. Electron paramagnetic resonance and magnetic studies for 1 demonstrated the complete localization of the single 3d electron on one of vanadium ion and very weak antiferromagnetic interaction between the paramagnetic vanadium(IV) ions in the crystal lattice. The cyclic voltammogram observed with 1, revealed one oxidation process which is tentatively assigned to VIVVV/V2V. [(L1)2(VVO)2(µ-O)](ClO4)2 (2.2.5CH2Cl2) has been synthesized chemically from 1 and were thoroughly characterized by X–ray crystallography, UV–Vis, 51V NMR and IR measurements. Herein we report the synthesis of five new mononuclear mixed ligand oxidovanadium(IV) complexes [VIVO(L1−3)(LNN)] (1–5) with tridentate O,N,O-donor aroylhydrazones as main ligand (H2L1–3) and N,N-chelating 2,2′-bipyridine (bipy) and 1,10-phenanthroline (phen) as co-ligand (LNN). The complexes were characterized by elemental and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), IR, UV–vis, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI–MS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The structure of 1–5 was confirmed by single crystal X-ray analysis and also optimized by density functional theory (DFT) methods. At physiological pH an equilibrium [VIVO(L1–3)(LNN)] + H2O ⇄ [VIVO(L1–3)(H2O)] + LNN, shifted towards left, is established, with water molecule that could be replaced by the biomolecules of the organism. The studies on the interaction with two proteins, lysozyme (Lyz) chosen as a representative model of a small protein, and human serum albumin (HSA) show that two types of binding are possible: a non-covalent binding through the accessible residues on protein surface with [VIVO(L1–3)(LNN)] keeping its octahedral structure, and a covalent binding upon the replacement of water in [VIVO(L1–3)(H2O)] with His-N donors to form VIVO(L1–3)(HSA). In vitro cytotoxicity of ligands and complexes were screened against human cervical cancer (HeLa) (IC50 = 7.39–15.13 μM), colon cancer (HT-29) (IC50 = 11.04–28.20 μM) and mouse embryonic fibroblast (NIH-3T3) cell lines (IC50 = 62.22–87.75 μM) by MTT assay. Particularly, 5 showed higher cytotoxicity than cisplatin and cyclophosphamide, with an IC50 of 7.39 ± 1.21 μM and 11.04 ± 0.29 μM against HeLa and HT-29. Diabetes mellitus (DM) will be one of the ten most deadly diseases in the near future, according to a WHO survey. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to design and synthesize effective inhibitors to be used in the treatment of DM disease. In this respect, a new series of chalcone derivatives and their vanadyl complexes of composition [VO(LI-III)2]SO4 and [VO(LIV)2] (where LI=1-(2-Hydroxy-phenyl)-3-phenyl-propenone, LII=1-(1-Hydroxy-naphthalen-2-yl)-3-phenyl-propenone, LIII = 1-(2-Amino-phenyl)-3-phenyl-propenone, LIV = 4-Hydroxy-6-methyl-3-(3-phenyl-acryloyl)-pyran-2-one) were designed and synthesized in this work. Physioanalytical, FTIR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, UV-Visible, EPR, SEM, EDX, and mass spectrometry data were used to establish their formation and validate their structures. After that, biological effects such as antiradical, α-glucosidase, and α-amylase inhibitory activities of synthesized vanadyl-chalcone complexes were assessed. Furthermore, the Density Functional Theory (DFT) studies with 6-31G*/B3LYP level were used to achieve optimal molecular geometries and HOMO-LUMO gap to analyze the chemical and kinetic stability of the complexes. Molecular docking studies were performed as well to investigate the interactions between the synthesized complexes and target enzyme viz. α-amylase and α-glucosidase. The in-vitro biological studies showed major and significant improvements upon the complexation of ligands. Complex 3 (for α-glucosidase) and complex 4 (for α-amylase), in particular, were found to have a remarkable ability to lower blood sugar levels. Otherwise, the potent α-glucosidase and α-amylase inhibitory activity was observed in all of the synthesized complexes. The complexes with the best IC50 values were studied further in terms of enzyme kinetics and displayed mixed inhibition with both enzymes. Furthermore, using the DPPH assay, the antiradical activity of chalcones and their vanadyl complexes was evaluated for their efficacy in releasing oxidative stress. From the obtained results, complex 3 and 4 exhibited remarkable antiradical activity. The understanding of the role of vanadium enzymes and of vanadium compounds (VCs) in biology, as well as the design of new vanadium-based species for catalysis, materials science and medicinal chemistry has exponentially increased during the last decades. In biological systems, VCs may rapidly interconvert under physiological conditions and several V-containing moieties may be formed and bind to proteins. These interactions play key roles in the form transported in blood, in the uptake by cells, in inhibition properties and mechanism of action of essential and pharmacologically active V species. In this review, we focus on the recent advances made, namely in the application of the theoretical methodologies that allowed the description of the coordinative and non-covalent VC–protein interactions. The text is organized in six main topics: a general overview of the most important experimental and computational techniques useful to study these systems, a discussion on the nature of binding process, the recent advances on the comprehension of the V-containing natural and artificial enzymes, the interaction of mononuclear VCs with blood and other physiologically relevant proteins, the binding of polyoxidovanadates(V) to proteins and, finally, the biological and therapeutic implications of the interaction of pharmacologically relevant VCs with proteins and enzymes. Recent developments on vanadium-containing nitrogenases, haloperoxidases and nitrate reductases, and binding of VCs to transferrin, albumins, immunoglobulins, hemoglobin, lysozyme, myoglobin, ubiquitin and cytochrome c are discussed. Challenges and ideas about desirable features and potential drawbacks of VCs in biology and medicine and future directions to explore this chemistry area are also presented. The deeper understanding of the interactions of V-species with proteins, and the discussed data may provide the basis to undertake the investigation, design and development of new potentially active VCs with a more solid knowledge to predict their binding to biological receptors at a molecular point of view. The reaction of potentially N,N,O-tridentate Schiff base ligands, Cl-LH, Br-LH, BrCl-LH and H-LH, with [VIVO(acac)2] in 2:1 ratio in methanol gave the corresponding mononuclear and dinuclear oxidovanadium(IV) complexes, VO(Cl-L)2 (1), VO(Br-L)2 (2), [(BrCl-L)2(H2O)V(μ-O)VO(BrCl-L)2] (3) and [(H-L)2(H2O)V(μ -O)VO(H-L)2] (4), in good yields. The ligands and complexes were fully characterized by elemental analysis and FT-IR spectroscopy. The ligands were also characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The oxidation state of V(IV)O with d1 configuration in all synthesized complexes was confirmed by EPR. Moreover, the structures of 2 and 3 were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis which revealed them as mono- and dinuclear vanadium(IV) complexes, respectively, with the ligands coordinated as bidentate chelates. The structure of 3 represents the first example of dinuclear V(IV) complex with O → VIV = O → VIV = O core (Cambridge Structural Database (CSD)\hspace{0pt}, version 5.42, update of May 2021). The cytotoxicity of ligands and complexes was evaluated towards ovarian (A2780), breast (MCF7) and prostate (PC3) cancer cells at 48 h. While ligands showed modest IC50 values ({$>$}42 μM), all complexes turned out to be effective in the range 3.9–17.2 μM. In particular, A2780 and MCF7 cell lines were the most sensitive to the newly synthesized V(IV)O complexes. The insulin enhancing activity, histological analysis and, testicular degeneration by a VIVO-complex containing the 2,2′-(ethane-1,2-diylbis(azanediyl))diethanolate ligand, VOIV(C6H14N2O2-κ2N,κ2O), abbreviated VIVO(BHED), were investigated in diabetic male Wistar rats. The complex was administered by oral gavage of freshly prepared solutions of vanadium complex. Biological studies demonstrated that the vanadium complex normalized the elevated glucose levels in male Wistar rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and these compounds also avoided common responses in diabetic animals such as weight loss and reduction in the size of the epididymis, prostate, testis and seminal gland. The 51V NMR and EPR studies showed the formation of VIVO(BHED) and the oxidation product [VVO2BHED]− with two possible decomposition pathways. In summary, these studies demonstrate that the VIVO(BHED) complex or its decomposition products show similar effects as insulin in decreasing elevated blood glucose levels.},

The collimated plane grating monochromator (PGM-) beamline at a bending magnet is setup at the BESSY-II synchrotron radiation facility within the framework of the blazed-grating production facility. Coupled to a versatile four-circle (ten axes) UHV- reflectometer as a permanent end station the whole setup is dedicated to at-wavelength characterization and calibration of the in-house produced precision gratings and novel nano-optical devices as well as mirrors, multilayered systems etc. It is also open to external projects employing reflectometry, spectroscopy or scattering techniques. According to its purpose, this beamline has specific features, such as: very high spectral purity, provided by two independent high order suppression systems, an advanced aperture system for suppression of stray light and scattered radiation, a broad energy range between 10 eV and 2000 eV, small beam divergence and spot size on the sample. Thus this Optics Beamline will become a powerful metrology tool for reflectivity measurements in s- or p-polarisation geometry with linearly or elliptically polarized light on real optics up to 360 mm length and 4 kg weight.},

Concentration of LNVIV(Et)(AlEt2Cl) dramatically increases in the presence of ETA, that correlates with the increase of the polymerization activity of the catalyst system 1/AlEt2Cl. The complex LNVIV(Et)(AlEt2Cl) can be precursor of the active species of polymerization.

This finding is surprising, as the corresponding fullerene LUMO levels are slightly different, which might result in decisive differences in the charge transfer step. We investigate ternary OSC (D : A : A) made of the donor polymer P3HT with stoichiometric mixtures of different fullerene derivatives, PC60BM : PC70BM and PC70BM : IC60BA, respectively. Using quantitative electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) we can distinguish between positive and negative polarons, localized on the specific molecules. We found that after the initial charge transfer step, the electrons are re-distributed over two nearby acceptors in agreement with their stoichiometry and their relative LUMO energy difference. Remarkably, the measured ΔLUMO differences in fullerene mixtures are reduced by an order of magnitude compared to that of the pristine materials, i. e., below 1 meV for PC60BM : PC70BM and (20±5) meV for PC70BM : IC60BA. Furthermore, we found that this reduced ΔLUMO explains the shift in open circuit voltage for D : A : A organic solar cells. We attribute these findings to hybridization, leading to an effective fullerene LUMO. Consequently, multi-acceptor blends are indeed a viable option for photodetectors and solar cells, as they combine the best electron acceptor and light absorbing properties.},

  abstract = {\{EPR\} spectra at 250 \{MHz\} for a single crystal of lithium phthalocyanine (LiPc) in the absence of oxygen and for a deoxygenated aqueous solution of a Nycomed triarylmethyl (trityl-CD3) radical were obtained at scan rates between 1.3 × 103 and 3.4 × 105 G/s. These scan rates are rapid relative to the reciprocals of the electron spin relaxation times (LiPc: T1=3.5 μs and T2=2.5 μs; trityl: T1=12 μs and T2=11.5 μs) and cause characteristic oscillations in the direct-detected absorption spectra. For a given scan rate, shorter values of \{T2\} and increased inhomogeneous broadening cause less deep oscillations that damp out more quickly than for longer T2. There is excellent agreement between experimental and calculated lineshapes and signal amplitudes as a function of radiofrequency magnetic field (B1) and scan rate. When \{B1\} is adjusted for maximum signal amplitude as a function of scan rate, signal intensity for constant number of scans is enhanced by up to a factor of three relative to slow scans. The number of scans that can be averaged in a defined period of time is proportional to the scan rate, which further enhances signal amplitude per unit time. Longer relaxation times cause the maximum signal intensity to occur at slower scan rates. These experiments provide the first systematic characterization of direct-detected rapid-scan \{EPR\} signals.},

  abstract = {The nuclear magnetic resonance of Ni61 has been studied in pure nickel powders. Both natural nickel (1.25\% abundant in Ni61) and enriched nickel (99.9\% abundant in Ni61) were used. The signal observed with a circuit sensitive to the absorption of power is a combination of absorption and dispersion modes. The amount of mode mixing is found to depend on the applied rf field, ambient temperature, annealing temperature, and external magnetic-field intensity. The mode mixing of the resonance is related to electronic losses in the sample. The saturation behavior of the individual absorption and dispersion modes is that of an inhomogeneously broadened line. From the saturation behavior an estimate of the enhancement of the applied rf level for nuclei in domain walls of about 7×103 is made. An additional broadening mechanism is observed in the enriched nickel, particularly at 77°K. Application of Redfield's theory of saturation at high rf levels leads to the conclusion that the additional broadening can be attributed to strong indirect exchange between nuclei. Frequency measurements from room temperature to 4.2°K made with a marginal oscillator in both the enriched and unenriched nickel are presented. A temperature-dependent frequency shift is found between the enriched and unenriched nickel which appears to be a maximum at about 200°K where the enriched nickel frequency is about 30 kc/sec higher. From room temperature to 536°K, frequency measurements made with super-regenerative circuits are reported. A comparison of the temperature dependence of the resonance frequency with the saturation magnetization is made.},

The temperature dependence of the dangling bonds and band-tail states in all cases shows a nearly quadratic behavior to temperatures far below the Debye temperature. The results are shown to be consistent with relaxation via two-level systems (TLS's). The TLS's make transitions between levels by phonon-assisted tunneling and flip spins by modulating the spin-orbit interaction. Hydrogen evolution studies allow us to vary the TLS distribution and show that the TLS density of states is related to the degree of departure of the network from its thermal-equilibrium value.},

In self-discharge process, the transfer of water includes the transfer of vanadium ions with the bound water and the corresponding transfer of protons with the dragged water to balance the charges, and the transfer of water driven by osmosis. In this case, about 75\% of the net transfer of water is caused by osmosis. In charge–discharge cycles, except those as mentioned in the case of self-discharge, the transfer of protons with the dragged water across the membrane during the electrode reaction for the formation of internal electric circuit plays the key role in the water transfer. But in the long-term cycles of charge–discharge, the net transfer of water towards +ve is caused by the transfer of vanadium ions with the bound water and the transfer of water driven by osmosis.},

Trace amounts of Li2MnO3 usually occur as a secondary phase in lithium-manganese spinels in the common high-temperature, solid-state synthesis, affecting the overall Li–Mn stoichiometry in the spinel phase and thereby the electrochemical performance. However, the formation of Li2MnO3 lower than 1 wt.\% can hardly be quantified by the conventional analytical techniques. In this work, we synthesized lithium-manganese spinels with different Li/Mn molar ratios and demonstrate that electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) enables quantifying trace amounts of Li2MnO3 below 10−2 wt.\% in the synthesized products. The results reveal that the formation of Li2MnO3 secondary phase is favored by lithium excess in the synthesis. Based on the quantitative evaluation of the EPR data, precise determining Li–Mn stoichiometry in the spinel phase in Li1+xMn2−xO4 materials can be assessed. Accordingly, it is possible to estimate the amount of lithium on 16d-sites in the Li-rich manganese spinels.},

Such measurements can provide clinicians with information that can impact directly on diagnosis and therapy, especially for oncology, peripheral vascular disease and wound healing. The other area of immediate and timely importance is the unique ability of in vivo EPR to measure clinically significant exposures to ionizing radiation ‘after-the-fact’, such as may occur due to accidents, terrorism or nuclear war. There are a number of other capabilities of in vivo EPR that also potentially could become extensively used in human subjects. In pharmacology the unique capabilities of in vivo EPR to detect and characterize free radicals could be applied to measure free radical intermediates from drugs and oxidative process. A closely related area of potential widespread applications is the use of EPR to measure nitric oxide. These often unique capabilities, combined with the sensitivity of EPR spectra to the immediate environment (e.g. pH, molecular motion, charge) have already resulted in some very productive applications in animals and these are likely to expand substantially in the near future. They should provide a continually developing base for extending clinical uses of in vivo EPR. The challenges for achieving full implementation include adapting the spectrometer for safe and comfortable measurements in human subjects, achieving sufficient sensitivity for measurements at the sites of the pathophysiological processes that are being measured, and establishing a consensus on the clinical value of the measurements.

  abstract = {Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy has been well established as a viable technique for measurement of free radicals and oxygen in biological systems, from in~vitro cellular systems to in~vivo small animal models of disease. However, the use of EPR in human subjects in the clinical setting, although attractive for a variety of important applications such as oxygen measurement, is challenged with several factors including the need for instrumentation customized for human subjects, probe, and regulatory constraints. This article describes the rationale and development of the first clinical EPR systems for two important clinical applications, namely, measurement of tissue oxygen (oximetry) and radiation dose (dosimetry) in humans. The clinical spectrometers operate at 1.2~GHz frequency and use surface-loop resonators capable of providing topical measurements up to 1~cm depth in tissues. Tissue pO2 measurements can be carried out noninvasively and repeatedly after placement of an oxygen-sensitive paramagnetic material (currently India ink) at the site of interest. Our EPR dosimetry system is capable of measuring radiation-induced free radicals in the tooth of irradiated human subjects to determine the exposure dose. These developments offer potential opportunities for clinical dosimetry and oximetry, which include guiding therapy for individual patients with tumors or vascular disease by monitoring of tissue oxygenation. Further work is in progress to translate this unique technology to routine clinical practice.},

There is a critical need to determine the magnitude of the exposure to individuals so that those with significant risk can have appropriate procedures initiated immediately, while those without a significant probability of acute effects can be reassured and removed from the need for further consideration in the medical/emergency system. It is extremely unlikely that adequate dosemeters will be worn by the potential victims, and it also will be unlikely that prompt and accurate dose reconstruction at the level of individuals will be possible. Therefore, there is a critical need for a method to measure the dose from radiation-induced effects that occur within the individual. In vivo EPR measurements of radiation-induced changes in the enamel of teeth is a method, perhaps the only such method, which can differentiate among doses sufficiently to classify individuals into categories for treatment with sufficient accuracy to facilitate decisions on medical treatment. In its current state, the in vivo EPR dosemeter can provide estimates of absorbed dose of\,±\,0.5 Gy in the range from 1 to \&gt;10 Gy. The lower limit and the precision are expected to improve, with improvements in the resonator and the algorithm for acquiring and calculating the dose. In its current state of development, the method is already sufficient for decision-making action for individuals with regard to acute effects from exposure to ionising radiation for most applications related to terrorism, accidents or nuclear warfare.},

The improvement is achieved by “shaping” (controllable variation of the outer diameter of a dielectric insert along its axial direction). Various shaping scenarios based on the principle of discrete solenoids and electromagnetic calculations have been considered. The dielectric insert having the most promising shape was manufactured from a bismuth germanate single crystal. The shaped insert increases the area at B1~{$>~$}0.9 B1max from 5.06 to 7.36~mm. Higher sensitivity and lower likelihood of quantitative errors have been achieved in pulse EPR experiments for “long” samples (whose length was comparable to that of the dielectric insert) in a shaped dielectric insert.},

A resonator composed of an array of diabolo antennas with a back-reflecting mirror is designed and fabricated. Simulations and THz EPR measurements demonstrate a 30-fold signal increase for thin film samples. This enhancement factor increases to a theoretical value of 7500 for samples confined to the active region of the antennas.

In experiments on frozen glycerol/water doped with nitroxide radicals, DNP signal enhancements up to a factor of 80 are observed (relative to 1H NMR signals with thermal equilibrium spin polarization). The largest sensitivity enhancements are observed with a new triradical dopant, DOTOPA-TEMPO. Field modulation with a 10 G root-mean-squared amplitude during DNP increases the nuclear spin polarizations by up to 135\%. Dependencies of 1H NMR signal amplitudes, nuclear spin relaxation times, and DNP build-up times on the dopant and its concentration, temperature, microwave power, and modulation frequency are reported and discussed. The benefits of low-temperature DNP can be dramatic: the 1H spin polarization is increased approximately 1000-fold at 7K with DNP, relative to thermal polarization at 80K.},

In particular, continuous-wave EPR (cw-EPR) spectra can detect the local conformational dynamics for proteins under various conditions. Moreover, pulse-EPR experiments on doubly spin-labelled proteins allow measuring distances between spin centres in the 1.5–8~nm range, providing information about structures and functions. This review focuses on SDSL-EPR spectroscopy as a structural biology tool to investigate proteins using nitroxide labels. The versatility of this spectroscopic approach for protein structural characterization has been demonstrated through the choice of recent studies. The main aim is to provide a general overview of the technique, particularly for non-experts, to spread the applicability of this technique in various fields of structural biology.},

  abstract = {Until very recently, analysis of bone biopsies by means of the method of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) collected after surgery or amputation has been considered as the sole reliable method for radiation dose assessment in hands and feet. EPR measurements in finger- and toenail have been considered for accident dosimetry for a long time. Human nails are very attractive biophysical materials because they are easy to collect and pertinent to whole body irradiation. Information on the existence of a radiation-induced signal in human nails has been reported almost 25~years ago. However, no practical application of EPR dosimetry on nails is known to date because, from an EPR perspective, nails represent a very complex material. In addition to the radiation-induced signal (RIS), parasitic and intense signals are induced by the mechanical stress caused when collecting nail samples (mechanically induced signals—MIS). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the RIS stability is strongly influenced not only by temperature but also by humidity. Most studies of human nails were carried out using conventional X-band microwave band (9~GHz). Higher frequency Q-band (37~GHz) provides higher spectral resolution which allows obtaining more detailed information on the nature of different radicals in human nails. Here, we present for the first time a complete description of the different EPR signals identified in nails including parasitic, intrinsic and RIS. EPR in both X- and Q-bands was used. Four different MIS signals and five different signals specific to irradiation with ionizing radiation have been identified. The most important outcome of this work is the identification of a stable RIS component. In contrast with other identified (unstable) RIS components, this component is thermally and time stable and not affected by the physical contact of fingernails with water. A detailed description of this signal is provided here. The discovery of stable radiation-induced radical(s) associated with the RIS component mentioned opens a way for broad application of EPR dosimetry in human nails. Consequently, several recent dosimetry assessments of real accident cases have been performed based on the described measurements and analyses of this component.},

Previously it was shown that the slow-scan lineshape could be recovered from triangular rapid scans by Fourier deconvolution. In this paper a general Fourier deconvolution method is described and demonstrated to recover the slow-scan lineshape from sinusoidal rapid scans. Since an analytical expression for the Fourier transform of the driving function for a sinusoidal scan was not readily apparent, a numerical method was developed to do the deconvolution. The slow scan \{EPR\} lineshapes recovered from rapid triangular and sinusoidal scans are in excellent agreement for lithium phthalocyanine, a trityl radical, and the nitroxyl radical, tempone. The availability of a method to deconvolute sinusoidal rapid scans makes it possible to scan faster than is feasible for triangular scans because of hardware limitations on triangular scans.},

  abstract = {In rapid frequency scan \{EPR\} with triangular scans, sufficient time must be allowed to insure that the magnetization in the x, y plane decays to baseline at the end of the scan, which typically is about 5T2 after the spins are excited. To permit relaxation of signals excited toward the extremes of the scan the total scan time required may be much longer than 5T2. However, with periodic, saw-tooth excitation, the slow-scan \{EPR\} spectrum can be recovered by Fourier deconvolution of data recorded with a total scan period of 5T2, even if some spins are excited later in the scan. This scan time is similar to polyphase excitation methods. The peak power required for either polyphase excitation or rapid frequency scans is substantially smaller than for pulsed EPR. The use of an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) and cross loop resonator facilitated implementation of the rapid frequency scan experiments reported here. The use of constant continuous low B1, periodic excitation waveform, and constant external magnetic field is similar to polyphase excitation, but could be implemented without the \{AWG\} that is required for polyphase excitation.},

The first part of the paper provides a detailed description of the operational principles of the surface resonators. It also includes sensitivity analysis for a variety of configurations with inner dimensions ranging from 150 μm down to 2 μm, operating at the Ku, Q, and W frequency bands. Most of the data presented here is based on theoretical predictions; however, some of it is accompanied by experiential results for verification. The second part of the paper describes a new type of double-surface microresonator and its production method. This new configuration enables an efficient coupling of the microwave energy from millimetre-sized microstrip lines to micron structures even at relatively low frequencies. The resonator is analysed both theoretically and experimentally – exhibiting ultra-high spin sensitivity. The conclusion of the two parts of the paper is that micron-scale surface microresonators may achieve spin sensitivity of a few thousands of spins in one second of acquisition time for special samples, such as phosphorous-doped 28Si, at cryogenic temperatures. However, further miniaturization below 1–2 microns does not seem to be beneficial, sensitivity-wise. In addition to their high spin sensitivity, these resonators have a huge conversion factor, reaching in some cases to more than 500–1000 G of microwave magnetic field with input power of 1 W. Some possible applications of these unique capabilities are also described herein.},

  abstract = {Further experimental results on level anticrossing and cross-relaxation effects in phosphorescent benzophenone and 4,4′-dibromobenzophenone crystals are reported. In addition to level anticrossing lines, and triplet-triplet and triplet-radical cross-relaxation lines, the spectra of 4,4′-dibromobezophenone show strong cross-relaxation with the bromine nuclear quadrupole states. A discussion is given of level anticrossing and cross-relaxation in order to explain the features of the spectra. Among others, the peculiar behaviour of the slow-recovery lines, attributed as before to cross-relaxation between the phosphorescent molecules and free hydrogen atoms, is explained by a thermodynamical model of cross-relaxation. While in the experiments mentioned above no r.f. or microwave fields are used, the application of a strong r.f. field gives, for magnetic fields close to the values where cross-relaxation occurs, rise to an effect analogous to the solid effect in N.M.R. These r.f. experiments shed light on the distinction between level anticrossing and cross-relaxation and on the magnetic interactions between the spins in our phosphorescent crystals. Finally it is shown how the present types of effect might be used for obtaining very high degrees of optical nuclear spin polarization.},

Through a comprehensive study by density functional theory and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies, the improved stability is attributed to the hydrochloric acid as optimal cosolvent providing chloride anions for a ligand-exchange process in the vanadium solvation structure. The role of the chloride counteranion in the solvation structure and dynamics of vanadium species was studied using combined magnetic resonance spectroscopy and DFT-based theoretical methods. The solvation phenomenon of multiple vanadium species and their impact on vanadium redox flow battery electrolyte chemical stability are discussed.},

  abstract = {The direct detection of free radicals is limited by their extremely short half-life in aqueous solution and this is likely to be even shorter in biological systems. However, this chapter describes how free radicals can be detected in biological systems with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy by the use of small diamagnetic probes, e.g., nitrone-based and hydroxylamines, and paramagnetic probes, e.g., nitroxides and trityl radicals. EPR is a powerful tool able to provide key information on the concentration of reactive species formed, the nature of the radical formed, the kinetics of radical formation, oxygen concentration, and more. This chapter describes the basis of EPR and also the chemistry and classification of spin trapping, the analytical technique used to detect and identify the nature and structure of transient free radicals. The kinetics and thermodynamics of spin trapping and adduct decay, which are the two key properties to be considered in using spin traps for radical detection, are described in detail along with the use of nitrones in the process. The biostability and cytotoxicity of spin traps are also discussed and the various routes for nitrone synthesis are detailed. The chapter also discusses how to interpret the EPR spectra to accurately provide information on the identity, molecular size, and nature of the radical species being trapped as well as their concentration. The chapter concludes with a detailed discussion of the applications of spin trapping and how to overcome challenges posed by the biological milieu and the detection of oxygen species.},

  abstract = {In a magnetic resonance spectrometer, a marginal oscillator is used as a transducer to convert a minute change in the tank coil resistance into a change in the amplitude of oscillation. Thus one can define a conversion gain as the ratio of the fractional change in the amplitude of oscillation to the fractional change in the tank coil resistance. Since the change in the tank coil resistance is made periodic at a low frequency to facilitate phase-sensitive detection, a study of the transient behavior of the oscillator becomes important. In this paper, the conversion gain, bandwidth, and noise associated with the oscillator are studied as functions of the circuit parameters, utilizing a piecewise linear characteristic for the active device. Unlike the studies carried out by other authors making use of a polynomial expansion for the nonlinear characteristic, the piecewise linear characteristic has been chosen because it is more amenable to synthesis. The sensitivity of the amplitude of oscillation to the variation of the characteristics of the active device has also been evaluated, and the relationship between the stability requirement of the device characteristics and the conversion gain has been established.},

The potential-dependent response of GO is reported for the first time and correlated with the observed electrochemical response. The EPR signal, deconvoluted into two constituent parts, was used along with lineshape simulations and the temperature dependence to probe the electrochemical processes. The EPR signal is found to be well described by two components. The narrower one is associated with unpaired electrons on localized functional groups and shows a reversible increase as GO is biased to positive potentials. The Curie behavior of this component suggests that it increases because of the formation of stable radical species, such as semiquinones, derived from quinones and other carbonyl functional groups found on GO. A stronger dependence of the narrow component with potential, and an elevated g value over 2.0034, is found in alkaline conditions compared to neutral electrolytes, reflecting the greater stability of seminquinone-like species at higher pH. By contrast, the second, broader component of the EPR signal was found to be potential-independent. The EPR approach described here offers a solution phase alternative, which can be employed under electrochemical control, to techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, as a means to probe the structure of GO and related materials.},

  abstract = {2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazine was crystallized from both tetrahydrofuran and chloroform. The crystal structures of samples from both preparations were determined by X-ray diffraction at low temperatures. Both crystals are clathrates with solvent molecules included as guest species in a host framework formed by the diphenylpicrylhydrazine molecules. The structures are rhombohedral, space groupR3. For the crystal from tetrahydrofuran, at 228 K,a = 25.820(4),c = 15.096(2) Å,Z = 18,R = 0.084 andwR = 0.133. For the crystal from chloroform, at 115 K,a = 25.453(12),c = 15.083(3) Å,Z = 18,R = 0.117 andwR = 0.153. Each unit cell contains three cavities which have approximate cylindrical shape with diameter 7.8 Å and height 6.0 Å, and 3 point symmetry. The integrity of the host framework is maintained only through van der Waals forces rather than through intermolecular hydrogen bonding as is found in many other known organic cathrates. The conformation of the trinitroanilino group of the hydrazine molecule is similar to that in the related trinitroanilinocarbazole molecule. The N-N bond approximates a single bond, and both hydrazine N atoms aresp2 hybridized.},

  abstract = {This work provides a systematic comparison of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), spatial resolution, acquisition time and metabolite limits-of-detection for magnetic resonance microscopy and spectroscopy at three different magnetic field strengths of 14.1 T, 17.6 T and 22.3 T (the highest currently available for imaging), utilizing commercially available hardware. We find an SNR increase of a factor 5.9 going from 14.1 T to 22.3 T using 5 mm radiofrequency (saddle and birdcage) coils, which results in a 24-fold acceleration in acquisition time and deviates from the theoretically expected increase of factor 2.2 due to differences in hardware. This underlines the importance of not only the magnetic field strengths but also hardware optimization. In addition, using a home-built 1.5 mm solenoid coil, we can achieve an isotropic resolution of (5.5 µm)3 over a field-of-view of 1.58 mm × 1.05 mm × 1.05 mm with an SNR of 12:1 using 44 signal averages in 58 h 34 min acquisition time at 22.3 T. In light of these results, we discuss future perspectives for ultra-high field Magnetic Resonance Microscopy and Spectroscopy. Low-field, mobile NMR systems are increasingly used across diverse fields, including medical diagnostics, food quality control, and forensics. The throughput and functionality of these systems, however, are limited due to their conventional single-channel detection: one NMR probe exclusively uses an NMR console at any given time. Under this design, multi-channel detection could only be accomplished by either serially accessing individual probes or stacking up multiple copies of NMR electronics; this approach still retains limitations such as long assay times and increased system complexity. Here we present a new scalable architecture, HERMES (hetero-nuclear resonance multichannel electronic system), for versatile, high-throughput NMR analyses. HERMES exploits the concept of software-defined radio by virtualizing NMR electronics in the digital domain. This strategy i) creates multiple NMR consoles without adding extra hardware; ii) acquires signals from multiple NMR channels in parallel; and iii) operates in wide frequency ranges. All of these functions could be realized on-demand in a single compact device. We interfaced HERMES with an array of NMR probes; the combined system simultaneously measured NMR relaxation from multiple samples and resolved spectra of hetero-nuclear spins (1H, 19F, 13C). For potential diagnostic uses, we applied the system to detect dengue fever and molecularly profile cancer cells through multi-channel protein assays. HERMES holds promise as a powerful analytical tool that enables rapid, reconfigurable, and parallel detection. In solids the detection of ionic motion covering the time range of milliseconds and longer is often accomplished using stimulated-echo spectroscopy. For spectral line widths much below or much above 1 MHz nonselective or fully selective radio-frequency pulse excitation, respectively, is typically applied in such experiments. To enable the study of samples with quadrupolarly broadened satellite spectra featuring intermediate widths (in the lower MHz range) the present work exploits microcoils. Using such coils, stimulated-echo spectroscopy can be performed under conditions of nonselective excitation for instance with 23Na as a nuclear probe. Nutation experiments carried out used to assess the coil performance. The impact of second-order quadrupolar interactions is studied using explicit density-matrix calculations. The applicability of the present approach is successfully tested for a sodium orthophosphate based solid ion conductor. A fully liquid-thermostatted micro-reactor probe head for 1H NMR spectroscopic studies of fast reaction kinetics, which was recently developed, is tested in the present work by studying fast esterification kinetics in the stopped flow mode. It is shown that reliable kinetic data can be obtained using this set-up for reactions with time constants down to a few seconds. The two test systems are the formation of methyl acetate (MA) and methyl formate (MF). Both are homogeneously catalyzed by sulfuric acid, which is added to the educts in different amounts. The temperatures of the kinetic studies are chosen between 303 and 333 K. The reaction kinetic data for both systems is correlated by activity-based kinetic models. For the MA formation, reference data from the literature is available, however only for regimes with time constants of minutes to hours. That data fits well to the results of the present study. The MF formation was studied here at conditions in which the time constants are of the order of seconds and therefore no reference data is available. The new probe head substantially extends the range in which NMR spectroscopy can be used for studies of fast reaction kinetics.},

  abstract = {Molecular doping allows enhancement and precise control of electrical properties of organic semiconductors, and is thus of central technological relevance for organic (opto-) electronics. Beyond single-component molecular electron acceptors and donors, organic salts have recently emerged as a promising class of dopants. However, the pertinent fundamental understanding of doping mechanisms and doping capabilities is limited. Here, the unique capabilities of the salt consisting of a borinium cation (Mes2B+; Mes: mesitylene) and the tetrakis(penta-fluorophenyl)borate anion [B(C6F5)4]− is demonstrated as p-type dopant for polymer semiconductors. With a range of experimental methods, the doping mechanism is identified to comprise electron transfer from the polymer to Mes2B+, and the positive charge on the polymer is stabilized by [B(C6F5)4]−. Notably, the former salt cation leaves during processing and is not present in films. The anion [B(C6F5)4]− even enables the stabilization of polarons and bipolarons in poly(3-hexylthiophene), not yet achieved with other molecular dopants. From doping studies with high ionization energy polymer semiconductors, the effective electron affinity of Mes2B+[B(C6F5)4]− is estimated to be an impressive 5.9 eV. This significantly extends the parameter space for doping of polymer semiconductors.},

The existing co-estimation methods address the model uncertainty by integrating the online model identification with state estimate and have shown improved accuracy. However, the cross interference may arise from the integrated framework to compromise numerical stability and accuracy. Thus this paper proposes the decoupling of model identification and state estimate to eliminate the possibility of cross interference. The model parameters are online adapted with the recursive least squares (RLS) method, based on which a novel joint estimator based on extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is formulated to estimate the state of charge (SOC) and capacity concurrently. The proposed joint estimator effectively compresses the filter order which leads to substantial improvement in the computational efficiency and numerical stability. Lab scale experiment on vanadium redox flow battery shows that the proposed method is highly authentic with good robustness to varying operating conditions and battery aging. The proposed method is further compared with some existing methods and shown to be superior in terms of accuracy, convergence speed, and computational cost.},

In this paper, a novel multi-timescale estimator is proposed to estimate the model parameters and SOC for vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) in real time. The model parameters and OCV are decoupled and estimated independently, effectively avoiding the possibility of cross interference between them. The analysis of model sensitivity, stability, and precision suggests the necessity of adopting different timescales for each estimator independently. Experiments are conducted to assess the performance of the proposed method. Results reveal that the model parameters are online adapted accurately thus the periodical calibration on them can be avoided. The online estimated terminal voltage and SOC are both benchmarked with the reference values. The proposed multi-timescale estimator has the merits of fast convergence, high precision, and good robustness against the initialization uncertainty, aging states, flow rates, and also battery chemistries.},

  abstract = {Cutaneous (skin) oxygenation is an important prognostic factor for the treatment of chronic wounds, skin cancer, diabetes side effects, and limb amputation. Currently, there are no reliable methods for measuring this parameter. Oximetry, using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, is emerging as a potential tool for clinical oximetry, including cutaneous applications. The problem with EPR oximetry, however, is that the conventional EPR design requires the use of a large magnet that can generate homogeneous field across the sample, making it unattractive for clinical practice. We present a novel approach that makes use of a miniature permanent magnet, combined with a small microwave resonator, to enable the acquisition of EPR signals from paramagnetic species placed on the skin. The instrumentation consists of a hand-held, modular, cylindrical probehead with overall dimensions of 36-mm diameter and 24-mm height, with 150-g weight. The probehead includes a Halbach array of 16 pieces (4×4×8 mm\textsuperscript{3}) of Sm-Co permanent magnet and a loop-gap resonator (2.24 GHz). Preliminary measurements using a Hahn-echo pulse sequence (800 echos in 20 ms) showed a signalto- noise ratio of \textasciitilde 70 compared to \textasciitilde 435 in a homogenous magnet under identical settings. Further work is in progress to improve the performance of the probehead and to optimize the hand-held system for clinical use},

Herein, the hybrid structure of tri-s-triazine unit in g-C3N4 framework is chemically analyzed and expounded according to the hybrid orbital theory. The localized π-conjugated structure of g-C3N4 is also monitored by the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) or electron spin resonance (ESR) technique. The experimental results indicate that this π-conjugated structure is attributed to the orbital overlapping of the hybrid carbon and nitride atoms in their 2pz orbits. Unlike graphene with the nonlocalized π-conjugated structure, this orbital overlapping in the whole two-dimensional plane of g-C3N4 is separated by the electrons pairs in 2pz orbits of the bridging nitride atoms, leading to the localized π-conjugated structure. Therefore, the g-C3N4 exhibits the typical features of a semiconductor with band gap and visible-light response. Meanwhile, the EPR or ESR technique can be acted as the ideal tool to indirectly evaluate the yield of photoelectrons by detecting the superoxide radicals (O2−) in g-C3N4-based photocatalytic reactions.},

  abstract = {State of charge (SOC) estimation is a key issue for battery management since an accurate estimation method can ensure safe operation and prevent the over-charge/discharge of a battery. Traditionally, open circuit voltage (OCV) method is utilized to estimate the stack SOC and one open flow cell is needed in each battery stack [1], [2]. In this paper, an alternative method, extended Kalman filter (EKF) method, is proposed for SOC estimation for VRBs. By measuring the stack terminal voltages and applied currents, SOC can be predicted with a state estimator instead of an additional open circuit flow cell. To implement EKF estimator, an electrical model is required for battery analysis. A thermal-dependent electrical circuit model is proposed to describe the charge/discharge characteristics of the VRB. Two scenarios are tested for the robustness of the EKF. For the lab testing scenarios, the filtered stack voltage tracks the experimental data despite the model errors. For the online operation, the simulated temperature rise is observed and the maximum SOC error is within 5.5\%. It is concluded that EKF method is capable of accurately predicting SOC using stack terminal voltages and applied currents in the absence of an open flow cell for OCV measurement.},

  abstract = {State of charge (SOC) of the batteries is a key indicator for battery monitoring and control. Long-term operation of vanadium redox flow batteries may cause ion diffusions across the membrane and the depletion of active materials, which will lead to capacity fading and increase in internal resistance. In previous studies, the capacity fading factor is not considered when designing the SOC estimation observer. This will cause a large error of SOC estimation if the capacity fading is significant. Thus, a selection of an adaptive SOC estimation method considering capacity fading factor is critical. In this paper, an adaptive observer-sliding mode observer-capable of monitoring SOC considering capacity factor is proposed based on a nonlinear electrical model. The observer is designed to adjust the capacity based on the decaying factor and compensate the error caused by the electrical model. A root mean square error of 0.013 V between the measured terminal voltage and estimated voltage is observed while a root mean square error of 0.12 V with the modeled voltage. The mean error between the observed and the modeled capacities is 0.14 Ah. The proposed method shows that the sliding mode observer could accurately estimate SOC with capacity fading.},

This fact is confirmed by lifetime measurements; the radiative decay of the fluorescence is decomposed into multiple-exponential curves. The dominant component (2.8 ms) of the decay curve for the broadband emission is equal to those (2.4 ms) for R1-line and its phonon sidebands.

As the degradation rate of the VRFB components is relatively low, less attention has been paid in terms of VRFB durability in comparison with studies on performance improvement and cost reduction. This paper reviews publications on performance degradation mechanisms and mitigation strategies for VRFBs in an attempt to achieve a systematic understanding of VRFB durability. Durability studies of individual VRFB components, including electrolyte, membrane, electrode, and bipolar plate, are introduced. Various degradation mechanisms at both cell and component levels are examined. Following these, applicable strategies for mitigating degradation of each component are compiled. In addition, this paper summarizes various diagnostic tools to evaluate component degradation, followed by accelerated stress tests and models for aging prediction that can help reduce the duration and cost associated with real lifetime tests. Finally, future research areas on the degradation and accelerated lifetime testing for VRFBs are proposed.},

Traditionally, ESR requires the use of complex instrumentation, including a large magnet and a microwave resonator in which the sample is placed. Here, we present an alternative to the existing approach by inverting the typical measurement topology, namely placing the ESR magnet and resonator inside the sample rather than the other way around. This new development relies on a novel self-contained ESR sensor with a diameter of just 2 mm and length of 3.6 mm, which includes both a small permanent magnet assembly and a tiny (∼1 mm in size) resonator for spin excitation and detection at a frequency of ∼2.6 GHz. The spin sensitivity of the sensor has been measured to be ∼1011 spins/√Hz, and its concentration sensitivity is ∼0.1 mM, using reference samples with a measured volume of just ∼10 nL. Our new approach can be applied for monitoring the partial pressure of oxygen in vitro and in vivo through its paramagnetic interaction with another stable radical, as well as for simple online quantitative inspection of free radicals generated in reaction vessels and electrochemical cells via chemical processes.},

The radical anion, DHAQ3–•, formed as a reaction intermediate during the reduction of DHAQ2–, was detected and its concentration quantified during electrochemical cycling. The fraction of the radical anions was found to be concentration-dependent, the fraction decreasing as the total concentration of DHAQ increases, which we interpret in terms of a competing dimer formation mechanism. Coupling the two techniques—EPR and NMR—enables the rate constant for the electron transfer between DHAQ3–• and DHAQ4– anions to be determined. We quantify the concentration changes of DHAQ during the “high-voltage” hold by NMR spectroscopy and correlate it quantitatively to the capacity fade of the battery. The decomposition products, 2,6-dihydroxyanthrone and 2,6-dihydroxyanthranol, were identified during this hold; they were shown to undergo subsequent irreversible electrochemical oxidation reaction at 0.7 V, so that they no longer participate in the subsequent electrochemistry of the battery when operated in the standard voltage window of the cell. The decomposition reaction rate was found to be concentration-dependent, with a faster rate being observed at higher concentrations. Taking advantage of the inherent flow properties of the system, this work demonstrates the possibility of multi-modal in situ (online) characterizations of redox flow batteries, the characterization techniques being applicable to a range of electrochemical flow systems.},
