  abstract = {Some metalloproteins which contain [2f-2S] clusters give EPR spectra characterized by gav ≈ 1.91, which is significantly lower than the value gav ≈ 1.96 usually obtained for the ferredoxins. A similar lowering of gav is observed for some [2F-2S]+ thiolate synthetic compounds in glass-forming solvents, or in compounds where phenolates replace thiolates as terminal ligands. We show that a good correlation is observed for all the proteins and synthetic compounds characterized by gav ≈ 1.91, when the main components, g1, g2, g3, of the g̃ tensor are plotted as a function of (g2 − g3). This correlation supports the existence of a new class of [2F-2S]+ clusters. A ligand-field analysis shows that the difference between the two kinds of EPR spectrum reflect essentially two different structures for the ferrous site. This conclucsion is in agreement with the spectroscopic studies performed on the Rieske protein from Thermus thermophilus.},

  abstract = {Approach for in vivo real-time assessment of tumor tissue extracellular pH (pHe), redox, and intracellular glutathione based on L-band EPR spectroscopy using dual function pH and redox nitroxide probe and disulfide nitroxide biradical, is described. These parameters were monitored in PyMT mice bearing breast cancer tumors during treatment with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. It was observed that tumor pHe is about 0.4 pH units lower than that in normal mammary gland tissue. Treatment with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor decreased the value of pHe by 0.3 units compared with PBS control treatment. Tumor tissue reducing capacity and intracellular glutathione were elevated compared with normal mammary gland tissue. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor treatment resulted in a decrease of the tumor tissue reducing capacity and intracellular glutathione content. In addition to spectroscopic studies, pHe mapping was performed using recently proposed variable frequency proton–electron double-resonance imaging. The pH mapping superimposed with MRI image supports probe localization in mammary gland/tumor tissue, shows high heterogeneity of tumor tissue pHe and a difference of about 0.4 pH units between average pHe values in tumor and normal mammary gland. In summary, the developed multifunctional approach allows for in vivo, noninvasive pHe, extracellular redox, and intracellular glutathione content monitoring during investigation of various therapeutic strategies for solid tumors.

  abstract = {We describe how the transient behavior of a tuned and matched resonator circuit and a ringdown suppression pulse may be integrated into an optimal control theory (OCT) pulse-design algorithm to derive control sequences with limited ringdown that perform a desired quantum operation in the presence of resonator distortions of the ideal waveform. Inclusion of ringdown suppression in numerical pulse optimizations significantly reduces spectrometer deadtime when using high quality factor (high-Q) resonators, leading to increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity of inductive measurements. To demonstrate the method, we experimentally measure the free-induction decay of an inhomogeneously broadened solid-state free radical spin system at high Q. The measurement is enabled by using a numerically optimized bandwidth-limited \{OCT\} pulse, including ringdown suppression, robust to variations in static and microwave field strengths. We also discuss the applications of pulse design in high-Q resonators to universal control of anisotropic-hyperfine coupled electron-nuclear spin systems via electron-only modulation even when the bandwidth of the resonator is significantly smaller than the hyperfine coupling strength. These results demonstrate how limitations imposed by linear response theory may be vastly exceeded when using a sufficiently accurate system model to optimize pulses of high complexity.},

  abstract = {In rapid scan EPR the rapidly-changing magnetic field induces a background signal that may be larger than the EPR signal. A method has been developed to correct for that background signal by acquiring two sets of data, denoted as scan 1 and scan 2. In scan 2 the external field B0 is reversed and the data acquisition trigger is offset by one half cycle of the scan field relative to the settings used in scan 1. For data acquired with a cross-loop resonator subtraction of scan 2 from scan 1 cancels the background and enhances the EPR signal. Experiments were performed at an EPR frequency of about 258 MHz, which is in the range that is commonly used for in vivo imaging. Samples include nitroxide radicals, a trityl radical, a dinitroxide, and a nitroxide in the presence of a magnetic field gradient. This method has the advantage that no assumption is made about the shape of the background signal, and it provides an approach to automating the background correction.},

Rotational correlation times τ c of spin probes and the intermolecular spin exchange rate constants k e were measured from EPR spectra at different temperatures and TEMPOL concentrations, and compared with the published data. The τ c values were calculated both by known equations and from the EPR spectra simulation. Rotation movements of TEMPOL in omimBF4 cannot be described by the model of the isotropic Brownian diffusion, which is valid for conventional solvents. The correct modeling of EPR spectra in RTIL can be achieved with the assumption of different rotational mobility of the spin probe around different molecular axes. The rotational, D rot, and translational, D tr, diffusion coefficients were calculated from τ c and k e values. The Debye–Stokes–Einstein law is valid in all three solvents while the dependence of D tr on T/η is not linear in Stokes–Einstein coordinates. The effective activation energy E rot a of the rotational movements in omimBF4 is noticeably higher than the corresponding values for conventional solvents, while the effective activation energies E tr a of the translational movements are comparable in all solvents studied.},

To this end, in addition to a quick introduction into ESR and its potential applications in food quality control, we discuss the shortcomings of a conventional ESR spectrometer concerning its miniaturization and cost reduction capabilities and highlight how IC technology based approaches can be used to overcome these limitations. As an extension to the state-of-the-art in IC-based ESR, we present an analytical model and experimental results for VCO-based rapid scan ESR experiments, which can be used to improve the achievable sensitivity in inductively detected ESR.},

  abstract = {Free radicals are thought to be key intermediates in the oxidation of wine, but their nature has not been established. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to detect and identify several free radical species in wine under oxidative conditions with the aid of spin traps. The 1-hydroxylethyl radical was the sole radical species observed when α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone was used as a spin trap in a heated (55 °C), low-sulfite (15 mg L−1) red wine. This radical appears to arise from ethanol oxidation via the hydroxyl radical, and this latter species was confirmed by using a high concentration (1.5 M) of the 5,5-dimethylpyrroline-N-oxide spin trap, thus providing the first direct evidence of the Fenton reaction in wine. Hydroxyl radical formation in wine was corroborated by converting hydroxyl radicals to methyl radicals by its reaction with dimethyl sulfoxide. The novel spin trap 5-tert-butoxycarbonyl 5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide was also used in this study to identify sulfite radicals in wine for the first time. This spin trap has also been shown to trap hydroperoxyl radicals, the generation of which is predicted in wine; however, no evidence of this species was observed.},

The development of new materials for Li-ion batteries is the focus of research in prominent groups in the field of materials science throughout the world. Li-ion batteries can be considered to be the most impressive success story of modern electrochemistry in the last two decades. They power most of today's portable devices, and seem to overcome the psychological barriers against the use of such high energy density devices on a larger scale for more demanding applications, such as EV. Since this field is advancing rapidly and attracting an increasing number of researchers, it is important to provide current and timely updates of this constantly changing technology. In this review, we describe the key aspects of Li-ion batteries: the basic science behind their operation, the most relevant components, anodes, cathodes, electrolyte solutions, as well as important future directions for R\&D of advanced Li-ion batteries for demanding use, such as EV and load-leveling applications.},

  abstract = {Exposure to particulate silica (most crystalline polymorphs) causes a persistent inflammation sustained by the release of oxidants in the alveolar space. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which include hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and singlet oxygen, are generated not only at the particle surface, but also by phagocytic cells attempting to digest the silica particle. Two distinct kinds of surface centers—silica-based surface radicals and poorly coordinated iron ions—generate O2•− and HO• in aqueous solution via different mechanisms. Crystalline silica is also a potent stimulant of the respiratory burst in phagocytic cells with increased oxygen consumption and production of O•−, H2O2, and \{NO\} leading to acute inflammation and HO• generation in the lung. Oxidative stress elicited by crystalline silica is also evidenced by increased expression of antioxidant enzymes such as manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase, and the enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Generation of oxidants by crystalline silica particles and by silica-activated cells results in cell and lung injury, activation of cell signaling pathways to include MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, increased expression of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factorα [TNFα], interleukin-1 [IL-1]), and activation of specific transcription factors (e.g., NFκB, AP-1). Silica can also initiate apoptosis in response to oxygen- and nitrogen-based free radicals, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased gene expression of death receptors, and/or their ligands (TNFα, Fas ligand [FasL]).},

The detector consists of an \{LC\} oscillator formed by a 200 μm diameter single turn aluminum planar coil, a metal–oxide–metal capacitor, and two metal–oxide–semiconductor field effect transistors used as negative resistance network. At 300 K, the oscillator has a frequency noise of 20 Hz/Hz1/2 at 100 kHz offset from the 20 \{GHz\} carrier. At 4 K, the frequency noise is about 1 Hz/Hz1/2 at 10 kHz offset. The spin sensitivity measured with a sample of \{DPPH\} is 108 spins/Hz1/2 at 300 K and down to 106 spins/Hz1/2 at 4 K.},

  abstract = {Abstract In portions of the magnetic resonance community, there is a misunderstanding of the process of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal generation and reception, and even in accepted texts, it is frequently described in terms of absorption and emission of radio waves, or radiation, by a two‐level quantum system. While this explanation can be refuted, for those who do understand that the NMR free induction decay signal is easily explained by Faraday's law of induction, reconciling the presence of an induced electromotive force with an apparent absence of transitions between nuclear energy levels causes conceptual problems. This difficulty is examined, and an explanation of the signal given whereby Faraday's law is explained simply in terms of an exchange of virtual photons. The article thus attempts to reconcile the standard engineering approach to signal reception with a quantum mechanical description of the NMR phenomenon. Radiation damping and its relations to detection of the induced signal and to signal‐to‐noise ratio are then scrutinized, and the misleading nature of the appellation noted. In the process, it is shown that while damping is inherently necessary for signal detection and the transfer of energy that it entails, the degree of such damping depends on the efficiency of the detector—in other words, of the preamplifier in the NMR receiver—and can therefore be minimized.

  abstract = {Abstract Confusion exists over the application of the Principle of Reciprocity to NMR signal strength calculations when wavelength in a sample is comparable to the latter's size. A simple and easily reproduced bench experiment that validates the principle is therefore described. Building on the experimental results, elementary mathematics are employed to derive simple equations for the B1 fields in both the negatively and the positively rotating frames. Using these equations, the reader is then guided through the steps needed to deduce correctly the signal received in an NMR experiment. The article should serve as a resource for those attempting signal strength calculations. © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Concepts Magn Reson 12: 173–187, 2000},

The method is shown, for a solenoidal receiving coil, to give the same results as the traditional method of calculation, but its advantage lies in its ability to predict the ratio for other coil configurations. Particular attention is paid to the poor performance of a saddle-shaped (or Helmholtz) coil. Some of the practical problems involved are also discussed, including the error of matching the probe to the input impedance of the preamplifier.},

  abstract = {A detailed analysis of line shapes and relaxation is made for the perdeuterated 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piper- idone AT-oxide (PD-Tempone) nitroxide radical covering the whole range from fast motional narrowing (tr \textasciitilde{}  10-12 sec) to the rigid limit (tr  \textasciitilde{}  10-6 sec) in several deuterated solvents. The slow tumbling results show particularly good agreement with the slow tumbling theory of Freed, et ai, for a reorientational model of moderate jumps (ca. 50° rms), and essentially isotropic reorientation. It is shown that while such a model may not be readily distinguished, purely from its slow tumbling spectral predictions, from a free diffusion model including inertial effects, the latter model is incompatible with most other considerations. However, a simple analysis explicitly including the fluctuating (or random) torques indicates that more fundamental analysis of the dynamics may explain the slow tumbling results without necessarily involving substantial jumps. The spectral analysis is considerably enhanced by the increased resolution obtained from the use of the perdeuterated spin probe and deuterated solvents. Careful analysis of results at X-band and 35 GHz has shown that the nonsecular spectral densities exhibit significant deviations from a Debye- like spectral density yielding results very similar to those recently reported for the peroxylaminedisulfon- ate (PADS) radical. Related observations are discussed of apparent non-Debye-like spectral densities in the incipient slow tumbling spectra. These anomalies are also found to be amenable to a unified explana- tion in terms of the fluctuating torques. The analysis of much of the results in terms of a simple model yields an rms value for the fluctuating torques of ca, V6kT and tm  \textasciitilde{}  tr where tm is the relaxation time of the torques. The high-temperature electron-spin flip processes are consistent with a Hubbard-type spin- rotational mechanism, but the low-temperature results may be due to spin-rotational relaxation from in- tramolecular motions. The simple analysis of spin-rotational relaxation in terms of relaxation of the fluc- tuating torques is found to yield equivalent predictions to conventional treatments when the estimated values of rms torque and tm are used.},

The echo-detected (ED) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) lineshape reveals strong dependence on the time interval τ between the echo-forming microwave pulses which is readily explained by anisotropic phase relaxation. Employing a librational model of molecular motion and the Redfield relaxation theory, spectra were simulated for the τ's varying in a large interval. The anisotropic relaxation rate increases with temperature increase and it is larger for nitroxide with a larger molecular size. The mean-squared amplitude of motion, obtained from reduced hyperfine splitting in continuous-wave EPR, near Tg linearly depends on temperature which is characteristic of harmonic solids. For tempone in a host crystal 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-cyclobutan-1, 3-dione the anisotropic spin relaxation rate decreases with temperature increase so the found feature solely belongs to a glassy state. A new approach is proposed for modeling slow wobbling motion in a restricted angular space.},

The ability to accurately quantify pH change in vivo and monitor spatial distribution is desirable for the assessment of a number of pathological conditions in the human body as well as the monitoring of treatment response. In this work we introduce a method for EPR-based pH mapping utilizing a method of spectral-spatial imaging of sequentially scanned spectra to decrease the missing gradient rotation angle, without increasing the spatial field of view. Repeated in vitro measurements of pH phantom tubes demonstrated higher precision measurements of the hyperfine coupling constant (HFC) compared to previous EPR-based methods, resulting in mean pH values accurate to less than 0.1 pH across a range of physiologically observed values.},

  abstract = {It is well established that the formation of radical species centered on various atoms is involved in the mechanism leading to the development of several diseases or to the appearance of deleterious effects of toxic molecules. The detection of free radical is possible using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and the spin trapping technique. The classical EPR spin-trapping technique can be considered as a “hypothesis-driven” approach because it requires an a priori assumption regarding the nature of the free radical in order to select the most appropriate spin-trap. We here describe a “data-driven” approach using EPR and a cocktail of spin-traps. The rationale for using this cocktail was that it would cover a wide range of biologically relevant free radicals and have a large range of hydrophilicity and lipophilicity in order to trap free radicals produced in different cellular compartments. As a proof-of-concept, we validated the ability of the system to measure a large variety of free radicals (O-, N-, C-, or S- centered) in well characterized conditions, and we illustrated the ability of the technique to unambiguously detect free radical production in cells exposed to chemicals known to be radical-mediated toxic agents.},

Appli- cations to studies of the transverse polarity profiles in lipid bilayers, which con- stitute the permeability barrier of biological membranes, are reviewed. Emphasis is given to parallels with the permeation profiles of oxygen and nitric oxide that are determined from spin-label relaxation enhancements by using nonlinear continuous- wave EPR and saturation recovery EPR, and with permeation profiles of D2O that are determined by using 2H electron spin echo envelope modulation spectroscopy.},

Both cations are non-Kramers ions and have J\,=\,6 ground states. Echo-detected spectra are compared with CW spectra and with field-stepped direct-detected EPR spectra. Due to the strong temperature dependence of T1, measurements were not made above 10~K. Between about 4.2 and 6~K T1 is strongly concentration dependent between 1 and\,\textasciitilde\,50~mM. T1 values at 4.2~K are in the µs range which is orders of magnitude faster than for 3d transition metals. Phase memory times, Tm, are less than 500~ns, which is short relative to values observed for 3d transition metals and organic radicals at 4~K. Tm is longer in the oxalate lattice which is attributed to the lower proton concentration in oxalate than in the organic solvent, which decreases nuclear spin diffusion. The rigidity of the crystalline lattice also may contribute to longer Tm.},

Highly-resolved spectra of 3-carbamoyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrrolidin-1-yloxy, diphenylnitroxide, galvinoxyl, and perylene cation radical with excellent signal-to-noise are shown, demonstrating the capabilities of the rapid-scan technique to characterize very small, well-resolved hyperfine couplings. To acquire high resolution spectra the signal bandwidth must be less than the resonator bandwidth. Signal bandwidth is inversely proportional to linewidth and proportional to scan rate. Resonator bandwidth is inversely proportional to resonator Q. Proper selection of scan rate and resonator Q is needed to achieve resolution of closely-spaced narrow EPR lines.},

  abstract = {X-band electron spin relaxation times of BDPA (1:1 α,γ-bisdiphenylene-β-phenylallyl), galvinoxyl 2,6-di-tert-butyl-α-(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-oxo-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-ylidene)-p-tolyloxy, DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and thianthrene radicals in fluid solution were measured by electron spin echo and inversion recovery at ambient temperature. Tumbling correlation times are estimated to be in the range of 20–30 ps. In this fast tumbling regime T 1 \textbackslash textasciitilde T 2. Relaxation times are compared with previously reported values for symmetrically substituted triarylmethyl, semiquinone, and nitroxide radicals. The concentration dependence of spin lattice relaxation for neutral BDPA in toluene is about 103 times greater than for anionic trityl radicals in water. T 1 decreases in the order carbon-center BDPA {$>$} galvinoxyl {$>$} DPPH {$>$} thianthrene. The dominant relaxation mechanisms are proposed to be a local mode for BDPA, spin rotation, local mode and modulation of anisotropic proton hyperfine coupling for galvinoxyl, modulation of anisotropic nitrogen hyperfine for DPPH, and spin rotation plus modulation of anisotropic proton hyperfine coupling for thianthrene.},

  abstract = {Free radical theory of aging hypothesizes that oxygen-derived radicals are responsible for the storage-related flavor instability in wine. In an optimal situation, a balanced-distribution exists between oxidants and antioxidants among wines intrinsic/extrinsic metabolites. Based on the kinetic study of POBN-1-hydroxyethyl spin adduct (POBN-1-HER) formation in wines initiated via the Fenton reaction, a novel tool based on EPR spin trapping methodology was developed to quantify wines resistance against oxidation. Antioxidant capacities of wines were evaluated according to POBN-1-HER maximum signal intensity (Imax POBN-1-HER) and rate formation (rPOBN-1-HER) kinetic parameters. Low Imax POBN-1-HER and rPOBN-1-HER values suggest that endogenous antioxidants in wine are able to quench a substantial amount of radicals capable to take part in deleterious oxidative reactions. This will be very valuable in understanding aging potential and will provide an avenue to better control the process by knowing how it might be possible to change wines resistance against oxidation.},

  abstract = {The isotropic and anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants and g-values of the nitroxide spin label (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSSL) were determined from 9-GHz and 95-GHz electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements in various solvents with a large distribution in polarity and proticity. The parameters Aiso, giso, Azz, and gxx of MTSSL were found to be sensitive to changes in solvent properties, where A-values increased and g-values decreased due to increased solvent polarity or proticity. A linear correlation was found for the isotropic (giso, Aiso) and anisotropic (gxx, Azz) parameters, respectively. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the same parameters were performed for a model spin label with the possibility to vary the dielectric constant (ε) of the medium and the number of hydrogen bonds formed with the nitroxide oxygen. From a qualitative analysis of experimental and calculated results, it was possible to specify the causes of the parameter shifts in more detail. In the “apolar region” (ε {$<$} 25), the sensitivity of Aiso and Azz to ε is large. However, in the “polar region” (ε {$>$} 25), the sensitivity to ε is small, and the shifts in Aiso and Azz are mainly determined by the proticity of the solvent. Methanol was found to form ∼1 and water ∼2 hydrogen bonds to the nitroxide on average. The DFT method determined the shifts in giso and gxx due to hydrogen bonding more accurately compared with the restricted open-shell Hartree−Fock method. The anisotropic spin label-solvent data can be used in the interpretation of rigid-limit data from spin-labeled proteins to gain further insight in local environmental properties.},

  abstract = {Organic matter (OM) sources and transfers are critical questions at the crossroad of ecology, hydrology and paleoenvironmental studies in karst environments. Recently chemical or isotopic characterisations of these organic matters have demonstrated their diversity in karst water and speleothems. However, knowledge of their origin and transfer from soil needs to be improved especially in karst environments where a mosaic of soils occurs. Here we investigate the applicability of the Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) signature of OM to seek different soil fingerprints in speleothems. The positions and the shapes of semiquinone-type radical’s EPR lines are considered as a robust signature of the organic matter through the different compartment of karst ecosystems. We demonstrate that the combination of EPR lines simulation constitutes a fingerprint that discriminates folic Leptosol developed on limestone outcrops from eutric Cambisols located in the dolines and topographical depressions. We also report the conservation of the thinner OM EPR lines after a water extraction of the organic matter from soils. Finally, OM EPR signatures were detected in two different speleothems sampled near each other: a stalagmite and a subaqueous flowstone. An unexpected two-orders-of-magnitude discrepancy between the free radical concentrations of the subaqueous flowstone and the soils on one hand, and the low free radical concentration of the stalagmite samples on the other, was ascribed to the kinetics of conformational changes in OM occurring during their transfer through karst either in fast or in slow water pathways. A folic Leptosol fingerprint was found in stalagmite and conversely, an eutric Cambisol fingerprint was found in the flowstone sample. This unexpected difference between the EPR signatures of the flowstone sample and stalagmite sample was ascribed to the masking of the Leptosol EPR signature (due to the low concentrations of free radicals) in the case of the flowstone sample and to the fact that the EPR signature of the stalagmite sample clearly shows the Leptosol is the sole source of the OM. Finally, the folic Leptosol fingerprint remains steady over the last four centuries covered by the stalagmite demonstrating that the source of the OM is stable over the growth period strengthening the interest of OM entrapped in speleothem for paleoenvironment studies.},

  abstract = {The difficulty in determining the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) line parameters of ferromagnetic semiconductors has been addressed. For these materials, the resonance line is very broad and lies at low resonance field, so that only a part of the line can be detected experimentally. Moreover, the line is of asymmetric (Dysonian) shape as described by the line shape parameter . We have compared values of line parameters derived by computer fitting of the whole experimental EPR line to the Dyson function (or modified Dyson function) with the values obtained by applying this procedure to the left and the right half of the line.},

  abstract = {In oxidative phosphorylation, complex I (NADH:quinone oxidoreductase) couples electron transfer to proton translocation across an energy-transducing membrane. Complex I contains a flavin mononucleotide to oxidize NADH, and an unusually long series of iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters, in several subunits, to transfer the electrons to quinone. Understanding coupled electron transfer in complex I requires a detailed knowledge of the properties of individual clusters and of the cluster ensemble, and so it requires the correlation of spectroscopic and structural data: This has proved a challenging task. EPR studies on complex I from Bos taurus have established that EPR signals N1b, N2 and N3 arise, respectively, from the 2Fe cluster in the 75 kDa subunit, and from 4Fe clusters in the PSST and 51 kDa subunits (positions 2, 7, and 1 along the seven-cluster chain extending from the flavin). The other clusters have either evaded detection or definitive signal assignments have not been established. Here, we combine double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy on B. taurus complex I with the structure of the hydrophilic domain of Thermus thermophilus complex I. By considering the magnetic moments of the clusters and the orientation selectivity of the DEER experiment explicitly, signal N4 is assigned to the first 4Fe cluster in the TYKY subunit (position 5), and N5 to the all-cysteine ligated 4Fe cluster in the 75 kDa subunit (position 3). The implications of our assignment for the mechanisms of electron transfer and energy transduction by complex I are discussed.},

Different approximations for the shapes and sizes of nuclear induction signals are derived for various limiting cases, depending (a) whether the passage of Hz is ` adiabatic ' or ` extremely non-adiabatic ' (very weak radio-frequency field) and (b) whether the relaxation times are shorter or longer than the period of the sweep of Hz. It is found that quite large signals may be induced by even a very weak radio-frequency field if the relaxation times are very long.},

  abstract = {A technology center for the production of high-precision reflection gratings has been established. Within this project a new optics beamline and a versatile reflectometer for at-wavelength characterization of UV- and XUV-reflection gratings and other (nano-) optical elements has been set up at BESSY-II. The Plane Grating Monochromator beamline operated in collimated light (c-PGM) is equipped with an SX700 monochromator, of which the blazed gratings (600 and 1200\hspace{0.25em}lines\hspace{0.25em}mm               −1               ) have been recently exchanged for new ones of improved performance produced in-house. Over the operating range from 10 to 2000\hspace{0.25em}eV this beamline has very high spectral purity achieved by (i) a four-mirror arrangement of different coatings which can be inserted into the beam at different angles and (ii) by absorber filters for high-order suppression. Stray light and scattered radiation is removed efficiently by double sets of               in situ               exchangeable apertures and slits. By use of in- and off-plane bending-magnet radiation the beamline can be adjusted to either linear or elliptical polarization. One of the main features of a novel 11-axes reflectometer is the possibility to incorporate real life-sized gratings. The samples are adjustable within six degrees of freedom by a newly developed UHV-tripod system carrying a load up to 4\hspace{0.25em}kg, and the reflectivity can be measured between 0 and 90° incidence angle for both               s               - and               p               -polarization geometry. This novel powerful metrology facility has gone into operation recently and is now open for external users. First results on optical performance and measurements on multilayer gratings will be presented here.},

  abstract = {The design and performance of the first commercial 94 GHz continuous-wave (CW-)/Fourier transform (FT-) EPR and ENDOR spectrometer are described. The spectrometer design is based on a heterodyne microwave bridge using an X-band intermediate frequency (IF), a hybrid magnet system, a variable-temperature, top-loading TeraFlex probehead with a TE011 cavity as well as the ELEXSYS-line digital electronics and the Xepr software package. The W-band bridge can be driven by a CW- or pulse-IF unit and delivers a microwave power of 5 mW at 94 GHz. In pulse mode the power is sufficient for a π/2 pulse of 100 ns at a resonatorQ-value of 3000. The magnet system consists of a 6 T split-coil superconducting magnet and a water-cooled room-temperature coil. The main coil can be swept over the full range from 0 to 6 T. The room-temperature coil has a 800 G sweep range around the persistent field of the main magnet. The ENDOR probe features a tuned circuit for1H nuclei allowing an RF π-pulse of 8 𝜇s with a 200 W amplifier. A broad-band setup is used for other nuclei. The E680 FT-EPR system utilizes the PatternJet pulse programmer and the SpecJet high-speed transient signal averager. The concerted action of these two devices results in a pulse EPR sensitivity equal or higher than in CW-EPR. Selected examples indicating the performance of the 94 GHz CW/FT-EPR and ENDOR systems are shown.},

The samples were nitroxide radicals, trityl (substituted triarylmethyl) radicals, and the oxygen-sensitive solid lithium phthalocyanine (LiPc), all of which are useful for in vivo imaging. The 2D spectral-spatial image demonstration was performed at 250 MHz, with samples in sealed tubes of various sizes arranged in a 3D-printed plastic holder. Maximum gradients of 10 G/cm gave a spatial resolution of about 0.1 mm for the narrow trityl and LiPc signals and about 1 mm for the nitroxide. The importance of proper selection of resonator bandwidth and scan rate for obtaining accurate linewidth information is demonstrated for a case in which the phantom is composed of species with signal linewidths and relaxation times that differ by more than a factor of 10.},

  abstract = {The design for a new XUV-Optics Beamline is presented. The collimated plane grating monochromator (PGM-) beamline at a bending magnet is setup at the BESSY-II synchrotron radiation facility within the framework of the blazed-grating production facility. Coupled to a versatile four-circle (ten axes) UHV- reflectometer as a permanent end station the whole setup is dedicated to at-wavelength characterization and calibration of the in-house produced precision gratings and novel nano-optical devices as well as mirrors, multilayered systems etc. It is also open to external projects employing reflectometry, spectroscopy or scattering techniques. According to its purpose, this beamline has specific features, such as: very high spectral purity, provided by two independent high order suppression systems, an advanced aperture system for suppression of stray light and scattered radiation, a broad energy range between 10 eV and 2000 eV, small beam divergence and spot size on the sample. Thus this Optics Beamline will become a powerful metrology tool for reflectivity measurements in s- or p-polarisation geometry with linearly or elliptically polarized light on real optics up to 360 mm length and 4 kg weight.},

  abstract = {A 1 ns resolution pulse shaping unit has been developed for pulsed \{EPR\} spectroscopy to enable 14-bit amplitude and phase modulation. Shaped broadband excitation pulses designed using optimal control theory (OCT) have been tested with this device at X-band frequency (9 GHz). FT-EPR experiments on organic radicals in solution have been performed with the new pulses, designed for uniform excitation over a significantly increased bandwidth compared to a classical rectangular π/2 pulse of the same \{B1\} amplitude. The concept of a dead-time compensated prefocused pulse has been introduced to \{EPR\} with a self-refocusing of 200 ns after the end of the pulse. Echo-like refocused signals have been recorded and compared to the performance of a classical Hahn-echo sequence. The impulse response function of the microwave setup has been measured and incorporated into the algorithm for designing \{OCT\} pulses, resulting in further significant improvements in performance. Experimental limitations and potential new applications of \{OCT\} pulses in \{EPR\} spectroscopy will be discussed.},

  abstract = {\{EPR\} spectra at 250 \{MHz\} for a single crystal of lithium phthalocyanine (LiPc) in the absence of oxygen and for a deoxygenated aqueous solution of a Nycomed triarylmethyl (trityl-CD3) radical were obtained at scan rates between 1.3 × 103 and 3.4 × 105 G/s. These scan rates are rapid relative to the reciprocals of the electron spin relaxation times (LiPc: T1=3.5 μs and T2=2.5 μs; trityl: T1=12 μs and T2=11.5 μs) and cause characteristic oscillations in the direct-detected absorption spectra. For a given scan rate, shorter values of \{T2\} and increased inhomogeneous broadening cause less deep oscillations that damp out more quickly than for longer T2. There is excellent agreement between experimental and calculated lineshapes and signal amplitudes as a function of radiofrequency magnetic field (B1) and scan rate. When \{B1\} is adjusted for maximum signal amplitude as a function of scan rate, signal intensity for constant number of scans is enhanced by up to a factor of three relative to slow scans. The number of scans that can be averaged in a defined period of time is proportional to the scan rate, which further enhances signal amplitude per unit time. Longer relaxation times cause the maximum signal intensity to occur at slower scan rates. These experiments provide the first systematic characterization of direct-detected rapid-scan \{EPR\} signals.},

  abstract = {Spinel-type lithium manganese oxides are considered as promising cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Trace amounts of Li2MnO3 usually occur as a secondary phase in lithium-manganese spinels in the common high-temperature, solid-state synthesis, affecting the overall Li–Mn stoichiometry in the spinel phase and thereby the electrochemical performance. However, the formation of Li2MnO3 lower than 1 wt.\% can hardly be quantified by the conventional analytical techniques. In this work, we synthesized lithium-manganese spinels with different Li/Mn molar ratios and demonstrate that electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) enables quantifying trace amounts of Li2MnO3 below 10−2 wt.\% in the synthesized products. The results reveal that the formation of Li2MnO3 secondary phase is favored by lithium excess in the synthesis. Based on the quantitative evaluation of the EPR data, precise determining Li–Mn stoichiometry in the spinel phase in Li1+xMn2−xO4 materials can be assessed. Accordingly, it is possible to estimate the amount of lithium on 16d-sites in the Li-rich manganese spinels.},

Previously it was shown that the slow-scan lineshape could be recovered from triangular rapid scans by Fourier deconvolution. In this paper a general Fourier deconvolution method is described and demonstrated to recover the slow-scan lineshape from sinusoidal rapid scans. Since an analytical expression for the Fourier transform of the driving function for a sinusoidal scan was not readily apparent, a numerical method was developed to do the deconvolution. The slow scan \{EPR\} lineshapes recovered from rapid triangular and sinusoidal scans are in excellent agreement for lithium phthalocyanine, a trityl radical, and the nitroxyl radical, tempone. The availability of a method to deconvolute sinusoidal rapid scans makes it possible to scan faster than is feasible for triangular scans because of hardware limitations on triangular scans.},

  abstract = {In rapid frequency scan \{EPR\} with triangular scans, sufficient time must be allowed to insure that the magnetization in the x, y plane decays to baseline at the end of the scan, which typically is about 5T2 after the spins are excited. To permit relaxation of signals excited toward the extremes of the scan the total scan time required may be much longer than 5T2. However, with periodic, saw-tooth excitation, the slow-scan \{EPR\} spectrum can be recovered by Fourier deconvolution of data recorded with a total scan period of 5T2, even if some spins are excited later in the scan. This scan time is similar to polyphase excitation methods. The peak power required for either polyphase excitation or rapid frequency scans is substantially smaller than for pulsed EPR. The use of an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) and cross loop resonator facilitated implementation of the rapid frequency scan experiments reported here. The use of constant continuous low B1, periodic excitation waveform, and constant external magnetic field is similar to polyphase excitation, but could be implemented without the \{AWG\} that is required for polyphase excitation.},

This overview focuses on how valuable information about metalloprotein structure–function relations can be obtained using a combination of EPR and ENDOR techniques. After an overview of the historical development and a limited theoretical description of some of the key EPR and ENDOR techniques, their potential will be highlighted using selected examples of applications to iron-, nickel-, cobalt-, and copper-containing proteins.

  abstract = {The direct detection of free radicals is limited by their extremely short half-life in aqueous solution and this is likely to be even shorter in biological systems. However, this chapter describes how free radicals can be detected in biological systems with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy by the use of small diamagnetic probes, e.g., nitrone-based and hydroxylamines, and paramagnetic probes, e.g., nitroxides and trityl radicals. EPR is a powerful tool able to provide key information on the concentration of reactive species formed, the nature of the radical formed, the kinetics of radical formation, oxygen concentration, and more. This chapter describes the basis of EPR and also the chemistry and classification of spin trapping, the analytical technique used to detect and identify the nature and structure of transient free radicals. The kinetics and thermodynamics of spin trapping and adduct decay, which are the two key properties to be considered in using spin traps for radical detection, are described in detail along with the use of nitrones in the process. The biostability and cytotoxicity of spin traps are also discussed and the various routes for nitrone synthesis are detailed. The chapter also discusses how to interpret the EPR spectra to accurately provide information on the identity, molecular size, and nature of the radical species being trapped as well as their concentration. The chapter concludes with a detailed discussion of the applications of spin trapping and how to overcome challenges posed by the biological milieu and the detection of oxygen species.},

The common marginal oscillator was less sensitive as this spectrometer could not be made very critical, which resulted in a large contribution of the 1/ f noise.},

  abstract = {Cutaneous (skin) oxygenation is an important prognostic factor for the treatment of chronic wounds, skin cancer, diabetes side effects, and limb amputation. Currently, there are no reliable methods for measuring this parameter. Oximetry, using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, is emerging as a potential tool for clinical oximetry, including cutaneous applications. The problem with EPR oximetry, however, is that the conventional EPR design requires the use of a large magnet that can generate homogeneous field across the sample, making it unattractive for clinical practice. We present a novel approach that makes use of a miniature permanent magnet, combined with a small microwave resonator, to enable the acquisition of EPR signals from paramagnetic species placed on the skin. The instrumentation consists of a hand-held, modular, cylindrical probehead with overall dimensions of 36-mm diameter and 24-mm height, with 150-g weight. The probehead includes a Halbach array of 16 pieces (4×4×8 mm\textsuperscript{3}) of Sm-Co permanent magnet and a loop-gap resonator (2.24 GHz). Preliminary measurements using a Hahn-echo pulse sequence (800 echos in 20 ms) showed a signalto- noise ratio of \textasciitilde 70 compared to \textasciitilde 435 in a homogenous magnet under identical settings. Further work is in progress to improve the performance of the probehead and to optimize the hand-held system for clinical use},

  abstract = {Electron spin resonance (ESR) is a powerful analytical technique used for the detection, quantification, and characterization of paramagnetic species ranging from stable organic free radicals and defects in crystals to gaseous oxygen. Traditionally, ESR requires the use of complex instrumentation, including a large magnet and a microwave resonator in which the sample is placed. Here, we present an alternative to the existing approach by inverting the typical measurement topology, namely placing the ESR magnet and resonator inside the sample rather than the other way around. This new development relies on a novel self-contained ESR sensor with a diameter of just 2 mm and length of 3.6 mm, which includes both a small permanent magnet assembly and a tiny (∼1 mm in size) resonator for spin excitation and detection at a frequency of ∼2.6 GHz. The spin sensitivity of the sensor has been measured to be ∼1011 spins/√Hz, and its concentration sensitivity is ∼0.1 mM, using reference samples with a measured volume of just ∼10 nL. Our new approach can be applied for monitoring the partial pressure of oxygen in vitro and in vivo through its paramagnetic interaction with another stable radical, as well as for simple online quantitative inspection of free radicals generated in reaction vessels and electrochemical cells via chemical processes.},

  abstract = {This work presents an integrated sensing platform for clinical electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The sensor core comprises a LC tank whose resonance frequency matches the radical Larmor frequency and detects its EPR signal via the change of the tank inductance. To achieve high sensitivity, the inductance variation is measured in a self-mixing interferometric fashion with an on-off modulated RF source to attenuate the noise from the source and the readout circuitry. A sensor prototype was fabricated in 28 nm CMOS. It achieved a spin sensitivity of 6.1×108 spins/rtHz with only 1.12 mW power consumption, demonstrating over 10× improvement in terms of power and sensitivity compared with prior arts of similar system complexity.},
