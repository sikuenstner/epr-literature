EasySpin provides extensive EPR-related functionality, ranging from elementary spin physics to data analysis. In addition, it provides routines for the simulation of liquid- and solid-state \{EPR\} and \{ENDOR\} spectra. These simulation functions are built on a series of novel algorithms that enhance scope, speed and accuracy of spectral simulations. Spin systems with an arbitrary number of electron and nuclear spins are supported. The structure of the toolbox as well as the theoretical background underlying its simulation functionality are presented, and some illustrative examples are given.},

The method is shown, for a solenoidal receiving coil, to give the same results as the traditional method of calculation, but its advantage lies in its ability to predict the ratio for other coil configurations. Particular attention is paid to the poor performance of a saddle-shaped (or Helmholtz) coil. Some of the practical problems involved are also discussed, including the error of matching the probe to the input impedance of the preamplifier.},

  abstract  = {Abstract We report on the design and characterization of a single-chip electron spin resonance detector, operating at a frequency of about 20 \{GHz\} and in a temperature range extending at least from 300 K down to 4 K. The detector consists of an \{LC\} oscillator formed by a 200 μm diameter single turn aluminum planar coil, a metal–oxide–metal capacitor, and two metal–oxide–semiconductor field effect transistors used as negative resistance network. At 300 K, the oscillator has a frequency noise of 20 Hz/Hz1/2 at 100 kHz offset from the 20 \{GHz\} carrier. At 4 K, the frequency noise is about 1 Hz/Hz1/2 at 10 kHz offset. The spin sensitivity measured with a sample of \{DPPH\} is 108 spins/Hz1/2 at 300 K and down to 106 spins/Hz1/2 at 4 K.},

  abstract = {In rapid frequency scan \{EPR\} with triangular scans, sufficient time must be allowed to insure that the magnetization in the x, y plane decays to baseline at the end of the scan, which typically is about 5T2 after the spins are excited. To permit relaxation of signals excited toward the extremes of the scan the total scan time required may be much longer than 5T2. However, with periodic, saw-tooth excitation, the slow-scan \{EPR\} spectrum can be recovered by Fourier deconvolution of data recorded with a total scan period of 5T2, even if some spins are excited later in the scan. This scan time is similar to polyphase excitation methods. The peak power required for either polyphase excitation or rapid frequency scans is substantially smaller than for pulsed EPR. The use of an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) and cross loop resonator facilitated implementation of the rapid frequency scan experiments reported here. The use of constant continuous low B1, periodic excitation waveform, and constant external magnetic field is similar to polyphase excitation, but could be implemented without the \{AWG\} that is required for polyphase excitation.},

  abstract = {In rapid scan \{EPR\} the magnetic field is scanned through the signal in a time that is short relative to electron spin relaxation times. Previously it was shown that the slow-scan lineshape could be recovered from triangular rapid scans by Fourier deconvolution. In this paper a general Fourier deconvolution method is described and demonstrated to recover the slow-scan lineshape from sinusoidal rapid scans. Since an analytical expression for the Fourier transform of the driving function for a sinusoidal scan was not readily apparent, a numerical method was developed to do the deconvolution. The slow scan \{EPR\} lineshapes recovered from rapid triangular and sinusoidal scans are in excellent agreement for lithium phthalocyanine, a trityl radical, and the nitroxyl radical, tempone. The availability of a method to deconvolute sinusoidal rapid scans makes it possible to scan faster than is feasible for triangular scans because of hardware limitations on triangular scans.},

  abstract = {We describe how the transient behavior of a tuned and matched resonator circuit and a ringdown suppression pulse may be integrated into an optimal control theory (OCT) pulse-design algorithm to derive control sequences with limited ringdown that perform a desired quantum operation in the presence of resonator distortions of the ideal waveform. Inclusion of ringdown suppression in numerical pulse optimizations significantly reduces spectrometer deadtime when using high quality factor (high-Q) resonators, leading to increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity of inductive measurements. To demonstrate the method, we experimentally measure the free-induction decay of an inhomogeneously broadened solid-state free radical spin system at high Q. The measurement is enabled by using a numerically optimized bandwidth-limited \{OCT\} pulse, including ringdown suppression, robust to variations in static and microwave field strengths. We also discuss the applications of pulse design in high-Q resonators to universal control of anisotropic-hyperfine coupled electron-nuclear spin systems via electron-only modulation even when the bandwidth of the resonator is significantly smaller than the hyperfine coupling strength. These results demonstrate how limitations imposed by linear response theory may be vastly exceeded when using a sufficiently accurate system model to optimize pulses of high complexity.},

  abstract = {A 1 ns resolution pulse shaping unit has been developed for pulsed \{EPR\} spectroscopy to enable 14-bit amplitude and phase modulation. Shaped broadband excitation pulses designed using optimal control theory (OCT) have been tested with this device at X-band frequency (9 GHz). FT-EPR experiments on organic radicals in solution have been performed with the new pulses, designed for uniform excitation over a significantly increased bandwidth compared to a classical rectangular π/2 pulse of the same \{B1\} amplitude. The concept of a dead-time compensated prefocused pulse has been introduced to \{EPR\} with a self-refocusing of 200 ns after the end of the pulse. Echo-like refocused signals have been recorded and compared to the performance of a classical Hahn-echo sequence. The impulse response function of the microwave setup has been measured and incorporated into the algorithm for designing \{OCT\} pulses, resulting in further significant improvements in performance. Experimental limitations and potential new applications of \{OCT\} pulses in \{EPR\} spectroscopy will be discussed.},

Rotational correlation times $\tau$                        c of spin probes and the intermolecular spin exchange rate constants k                        e were measured from EPR spectra at different temperatures and TEMPOL concentrations, and compared with the published data. The $\tau$                        c values were calculated both by known equations and from the EPR spectra simulation. Rotation movements of TEMPOL in omimBF4 cannot be described by the model of the isotropic Brownian diffusion, which is valid for conventional solvents. The correct modeling of EPR spectra in RTIL can be achieved with the assumption of different rotational mobility of the spin probe around different molecular axes. The rotational, D                        rot, and translational, D                        tr, diffusion coefficients were calculated from $\tau$                        c and k                        e values. The Debye--Stokes--Einstein law is valid in all three solvents while the dependence of D                        tr on T/$\eta$ is not linear in Stokes--Einstein coordinates. The effective activation energy E                                          rot                  a                 of the rotational movements in omimBF4 is noticeably higher than the corresponding values for conventional solvents, while the effective activation energies E                                          tr                  a                 of the translational movements are comparable in all solvents studied.},

The correlation between these two characteristics of DPPH, the behaviour of which is found to be unpredictably strange, unambiguously shows that the problem for calibration of DPPH in order to be used as a primary standard for quantitative EPR spectrometry purpose is not solved yet. This problem needs additional studies in order to find exact methods for examination of the data concerning DPPH quantitative characteristics before its use.},

The echo-detected (ED) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) lineshape reveals strong dependence on the time interval $\tau$ between the echo-forming microwave pulses which is readily explained by anisotropic phase relaxation. Employing a librational model of molecular motion and the Redfield relaxation theory, spectra were simulated for the $\tau$'s varying in a large interval. The anisotropic relaxation rate increases with temperature increase and it is larger for nitroxide with a larger molecular size. The mean-squared amplitude of motion, obtained from reduced hyperfine splitting in continuous-wave EPR, near Tg linearly depends on temperature which is characteristic of harmonic solids. For tempone in a host crystal 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-cyclobutan-1, 3-dione the anisotropic spin relaxation rate decreases with temperature increase so the found feature solely belongs to a glassy state. A new approach is proposed for modeling slow wobbling motion in a restricted angular space.},

  abstract = {The design and performance of the first commercial 94 GHz continuous-wave (CW-)/Fourier transform (FT-) EPR and ENDOR spectrometer are described. The spectrometer design is based on a heterodyne microwave bridge using an X-band intermediate frequency (IF), a hybrid magnet system, a variable-temperature, top-loading TeraFlex probehead with a TE011 cavity as well as the ELEXSYS-line digital electronics and the Xepr software package. The W-band bridge can be driven by a CW- or pulse-IF unit and delivers a microwave power of 5 mW at 94 GHz. In pulse mode the power is sufficient for a $\pi$/2 pulse of 100 ns at a resonatorQ-value of 3000. The magnet system consists of a 6 T split-coil superconducting magnet and a water-cooled room-temperature coil. The main coil can be swept over the full range from 0 to 6 T. The room-temperature coil has a 800 G sweep range around the persistent field of the main magnet. The ENDOR probe features a tuned circuit for1H nuclei allowing an RF $\pi$-pulse of 8 $\mu$s with a 200 W amplifier. A broad-band setup is used for other nuclei. The E680 FT-EPR system utilizes the PatternJet pulse programmer and the SpecJet high-speed transient signal averager. The concerted action of these two devices results in a pulse EPR sensitivity equal or higher than in CW-EPR. Selected examples indicating the performance of the 94 GHz CW/FT-EPR and ENDOR systems are shown.},

  abstract  = {\{EPR\} spectra at 250 \{MHz\} for a single crystal of lithium phthalocyanine (LiPc) in the absence of oxygen and for a deoxygenated aqueous solution of a Nycomed triarylmethyl (trityl-CD3) radical were obtained at scan rates between 1.3 × 103 and 3.4 × 105 G/s. These scan rates are rapid relative to the reciprocals of the electron spin relaxation times (LiPc: T1=3.5 μs and T2=2.5 μs; trityl: T1=12 μs and T2=11.5 μs) and cause characteristic oscillations in the direct-detected absorption spectra. For a given scan rate, shorter values of \{T2\} and increased inhomogeneous broadening cause less deep oscillations that damp out more quickly than for longer T2. There is excellent agreement between experimental and calculated lineshapes and signal amplitudes as a function of radiofrequency magnetic field (B1) and scan rate. When \{B1\} is adjusted for maximum signal amplitude as a function of scan rate, signal intensity for constant number of scans is enhanced by up to a factor of three relative to slow scans. The number of scans that can be averaged in a defined period of time is proportional to the scan rate, which further enhances signal amplitude per unit time. Longer relaxation times cause the maximum signal intensity to occur at slower scan rates. These experiments provide the first systematic characterization of direct-detected rapid-scan \{EPR\} signals.},

  abstract = {Exposure to particulate silica (most crystalline polymorphs) causes a persistent inflammation sustained by the release of oxidants in the alveolar space. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which include hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and singlet oxygen, are generated not only at the particle surface, but also by phagocytic cells attempting to digest the silica particle. Two distinct kinds of surface centers—silica-based surface radicals and poorly coordinated iron ions—generate O2•− and HO• in aqueous solution via different mechanisms. Crystalline silica is also a potent stimulant of the respiratory burst in phagocytic cells with increased oxygen consumption and production of O•−, H2O2, and \{NO\} leading to acute inflammation and HO• generation in the lung. Oxidative stress elicited by crystalline silica is also evidenced by increased expression of antioxidant enzymes such as manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase, and the enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Generation of oxidants by crystalline silica particles and by silica-activated cells results in cell and lung injury, activation of cell signaling pathways to include MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, increased expression of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factorα [TNFα], interleukin-1 [IL-1]), and activation of specific transcription factors (e.g., NFκB, AP-1). Silica can also initiate apoptosis in response to oxygen- and nitrogen-based free radicals, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased gene expression of death receptors, and/or their ligands (TNFα, Fas ligand [FasL]).},

The development of new materials for Li-ion batteries is the focus of research in prominent groups in the field of materials science throughout the world. Li-ion batteries can be considered to be the most impressive success story of modern electrochemistry in the last two decades. They power most of today{'}s portable devices{,} and seem to overcome the psychological barriers against the use of such high energy density devices on a larger scale for more demanding applications{,} such as EV. Since this field is advancing rapidly and attracting an increasing number of researchers{,} it is important to provide current and timely updates of this constantly changing technology. In this review{,} we describe the key aspects of Li-ion batteries: the basic science behind their operation{,} the most relevant components{,} anodes{,} cathodes{,} electrolyte solutions{,} as well as important future directions for R&D of advanced Li-ion batteries for demanding use{,} such as EV and load-leveling applications.},

  abstract = {Spinel-type lithium manganese oxides are considered as promising cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Trace amounts of Li2MnO3 usually occur as a secondary phase in lithium-manganese spinels in the common high-temperature, solid-state synthesis, affecting the overall Li--Mn stoichiometry in the spinel phase and thereby the electrochemical performance. However, the formation of Li2MnO3 lower than 1 wt.{\%} can hardly be quantified by the conventional analytical techniques. In this work, we synthesized lithium-manganese spinels with different Li/Mn molar ratios and demonstrate that electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) enables quantifying trace amounts of Li2MnO3 below 10−2 wt.{\%} in the synthesized products. The results reveal that the formation of Li2MnO3 secondary phase is favored by lithium excess in the synthesis. Based on the quantitative evaluation of the EPR data, precise determining Li--Mn stoichiometry in the spinel phase in Li1+xMn2−xO4 materials can be assessed. Accordingly, it is possible to estimate the amount of lithium on 16d-sites in the Li-rich manganese spinels.},

A simple and easily reproduced bench experiment that validates the principle is therefore described. Building on the experimental results, elementary mathematics are employed to derive simple equations for the B1 fields in both the negatively and the positively rotating frames. Using these equations, the reader is then guided through the steps needed to deduce correctly the signal received in an NMR experiment.

  abstract = {Abstract In portions of the magnetic resonance community, there is a misunderstanding of the process of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal generation and reception, and even in accepted texts, it is frequently described in terms of absorption and emission of radio waves, or radiation, by a two‐level quantum system. While this explanation can be refuted, for those who do understand that the NMR free induction decay signal is easily explained by Faraday's law of induction, reconciling the presence of an induced electromotive force with an apparent absence of transitions between nuclear energy levels causes conceptual problems. This difficulty is examined, and an explanation of the signal given whereby Faraday's law is explained simply in terms of an exchange of virtual photons. The article thus attempts to reconcile the standard engineering approach to signal reception with a quantum mechanical description of the NMR phenomenon. Radiation damping and its relations to detection of the induced signal and to signal‐to‐noise ratio are then scrutinized, and the misleading nature of the appellation noted. In the process, it is shown that while damping is inherently necessary for signal detection and the transfer of energy that it entails, the degree of such damping depends on the efficiency of the detector—in other words, of the preamplifier in the NMR receiver—and can therefore be minimized. Mathematics in the article is kept to a minimum; proofs of the Principle of Reciprocity description of Faraday's law for reception of both signal and noise from a conducting sample are given in an appendix. ©1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc. Concepts Magn Reson 9: 277–297, 1997},
