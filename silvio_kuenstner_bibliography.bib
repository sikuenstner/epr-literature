  abstract = {Techniques based on spin resonance effects are amongst the most powerful analytical methods in both modern chemistry and medicine. Recent years have seen a trend toward scaled-down detection coils, exploiting the fact that a reduction of the detector size in principle increases the spin sensitivity of the detector [74, 144]. This improved spin sensitivity opens up a new range of applications: In NMR and ESR spectroscopy, the scaled-down detector size allows for the study of mass-limited samples with volumes in the microliter and nanoliter range [16, 111, 157, 162] while in NMR and ESR microscopy applications miniaturized detectors are used to perform high spatial resolution imaging on small objects [6, 10, 122, 136, 139, 156]. Here, the improved spin sensitivity ensures reasonable acquisition times even for spatial resolutions in the micrometer range. In this thesis, fully-integrated and hybrid CMOS detectors for both NMR and ESR applications with varying degrees of integration have been realized and tested. Here, the last generation of fully-integrated receivers, realized in a 0.13 μm CMOS technology, co- integrates a detection coil with a diameter of 345 μm together with a complete quadrature receiver consisting of a low noise amplifier (LNA), a quadrature downconversion mixer and a baseband amplification stage. Thanks to the use of the modern integrated circuit technologies with its scaled-down feature sizes, the receiver is designed to fit entirely underneath the detection coil, allowing for the design of densely packed arrays of receivers. The best measured time-domain spin sensitivity of the fully-integrated designs is 9 ×1013 spins/ Hz at an operating frequency of 300 MHz corresponding to 1H NMR in a 7 T magnet. First prototypes of densely-packed arrays in an older 0.35μm CMOS technology have been designed and tested. In these designs, the size of the detection coils is (520 μm)2 . Due to the larger size of the detection coil and the older technology, the measured time-domain spin sensitivities are about an order of magnitude worse compared to the designs realized in the 0.13 μm technology. Apart from the sensitivity tests a first model of the inter-channel crosstalk has been developed and verified which should allow for software-based cross-talk reduction in future versions of arrays. In addition to the circuit realizations, a complete modeling of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance for fully-integrated radio frequency (RF) frontends for NMR applications has been developed, which includes both the intrinsic coil SNR and the additional contribution from the LNA. The model allows for the selection of an optimum size of the detection coil as well as the choice of the optimum technology and topology of the entire RF frontend for a given application. Apart from the fully-integrated receivers, small arrays of hybrid detection systems consisting of external, high-quality solenoidal microcoils and custom-designed CMOS receivers have been designed and tested. Here, the best measured spin sensitivity is about 5×1013 spins/ Hz. In a very specific application for fully-integrated CMOS receivers for NMR, a prototype of an NMR-based positioning sensor for magnetic resonance based surgical guidance has been developed. The microsystem achieves a three-dimensional isotropic spatial resolution of 150 μm in a measuring time of 100 ms. Besides the work on integrated NMR detectors, a fully-integrated frequency-sensitive ESR sensor has been realized. The chip consists of an on-chip LC tank oscillator with a diameter of the on-chip inductor of about 100 μm, a frequency division module and an output buffer. It works in the K-band at an operating frequency of about 27 GHz and achieves a spin sensitivity of about 1.9 × 108 spins/ Hz, which is the best spin sensitivity achieved using inductive detection methods reported up to now. In addition to the circuit design and testing of the ESR system, a complete model of the SNR performance of frequency-sensitive ESR detectors has been developed and verified against measurements. Here, the noise modeling is of particular interest, because it applies a special case of Bogoliubov’s asymptotic method to an LC tank oscillator, resulting in analytical expressions for the phase and frequency noise behavior of such systems which give accurate predictions, agreeing within a few dB with measured results, but furthermore provide the designer with useful insights into design critical tradeoffs.},

At low frequencies two types of dispersion mechanisms are found: an interfacial process known as type “B” present in both materials, and an orientation polarization known as type “A” depending on the deposition rate and only found in silicon oxide. The activation energy for these processes is in the range 0.5-0.8 eV. At higher frequencies, a square-law dependence of conductivity on frequency is observed in both oxides, with a much lower activation energy, and is interpreted in terms of hopping conduction.},

  abstract = {The field of electron spin resonance (ESR) is in constant need of improving its capabilities. Among other things, this means having better resonators to reach improved spin sensitivity and enable larger microwave-power-to-microwave-magnetic-field conversion factors. Surface micro-resonators, made of small metallic patches on a dielectric substrate, provide very good absolute spin sensitivity and high conversion factors due to their very small mode volume. However, such resonators suffer from relatively low spin concentration sensitivity and a low-quality factor, a fact that offsets some of their significant potential advantages. The use of superconducting patches to replace the metallic layer seems a reasonable and straightforward solution to the quality factor issue, at least for measurements carried out at cryogenic temperatures. Nevertheless, superconducting materials, especially those that can operate at moderate cryogenic temperatures, are not easily incorporated into setups requiring high magnetic fields due to the electric current vortices generated in the latter’s surface. This makes the transition from normal conducting materials to superconductors highly nontrivial. Here we present the design, fabrication, and testing results of surface micro-resonators made of yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO), a superconducting material that operates also at high magnetic fields and makes it possible to pursue ESR at moderate cryogenic temperatures (up to\,∼\,80\,K). We show that with a unique experimental setup, these resonators can be made to operate well even at high fields of\,∼\,1.2\,T. Furthermore, we analyze the effect of current vortices on the ESR signal and the spins' coherence times. Finally, we provide a head-to-head comparison of YBCO vs copper resonators of the same dimensions, which clearly shows their pros and cons and directs us to future potential developments and improvements in this field.},

They are an isostructure of a monoclinic system with a space group of P21/n. For BDPA–Bz, a = 9.502(2), b = 14.632(2), c = 19.452(2) Å, β = 93.64(1)°, V = 2699(1) Å3, Z = 4, Dx = 1.220 g cm−3.

The final R values are 0.043 and 0.062 for 5.47 and 3.93 ratio of the observed reflections versus the parameters for BDPA–Bz and BDPA–Ac, respectively. The BDPA molecules in both crystals have the same propeller shape with an approximated C2 symmetry. The molecular packing of these crystals does not show a one-dimensional stacking, in spite of the magnetic one-dimensionality elucidated by the magnetic susceptibilites. The exchange pathways are discussed based on the McConnell’s spin-density Hamiltonian.},

The well-known features are reconfirmed: (1) at low values of \$\$\textbackslash omega\_\{\textbackslash text\{ex\}\}\$\$where the lines broaden, shift toward the center of the spectrum, and change shape due to the introduction of a resonance of the form of a dispersion component; (2) at values of \$\$\textbackslash omega\_\{\textbackslash text\{ex\}\}\$\$comparable to \$\$A\_\{0\}\$\$, where the lines merge into one; and (3) at values much larger than \$\$A\_\{0\}\$\$, where the merged line narrows. It is found that each line of a spectrum may be decomposed into an admixture of a single absorption and a single dispersion component of Lorentzian shape. These two- or three-line absorption–dispersion admixtures, for 15N and 14N, respectively, retain their individual identities even after the spectrum has merged and has begun to narrow. For both isotopes, the average broadening and integrated intensities are equal to the predictions of perturbation theory although, in the case of 14N, the outer lines broaden faster than the central line and intensity moves from the outer lines to the central line. In fact, the outer line intensity becomes zero and then negative at higher values of \$\$\textbackslash omega\_\{\textbackslash text\{ex\}\}\$\$which is compensated by the central line becoming more intense than the overall integrated intensity. For both isotopes, the dispersion components and the line shifts depart from the perturbation predictions. The results are presented in terms of measurable quantities normalized to \$\$A\_\{0\}\$\$so that they may be applied to any two- or three-line spectrum.},

A similar lowering of gav is observed for some [2F-2S]+ thiolate synthetic compounds in glass-forming solvents, or in compounds where phenolates replace thiolates as terminal ligands. We show that a good correlation is observed for all the proteins and synthetic compounds characterized by gav ≈ 1.91, when the main components, g1, g2, g3, of the g̃ tensor are plotted as a function of (g2 − g3). This correlation supports the existence of a new class of [2F-2S]+ clusters. A ligand-field analysis shows that the difference between the two kinds of EPR spectrum reflect essentially two different structures for the ferrous site. This conclucsion is in agreement with the spectroscopic studies performed on the Rieske protein from Thermus thermophilus.},

Special attention is given to the uniqueness and the advantages of the conventional “induction” detection method with respect to other emerging sensitive magnetic resonance detection and imaging techniques. Following this, a theoretical description of the factors affecting the sensitivity and resolution in induction detection ESR is provided. Based on the theory, new approaches to substantially improve ESR capabilities, both at room temperature and at low cryogenic temperatures, are discussed. Representative results of experiments conducted at room temperature and at frequencies of 10–16 GHz show that with test samples, a sensitivity of \textasciitilde 107 electron spins and a resolution of \textasciitilde 3 microns are currently available. The results confirm the validity of the theoretical approach and confirm the value of striving for even higher frequencies and lower temperatures, in order to further improve the performance Finally, some of the current and potential applications of ESR microscopy and nanoscopy (involving imaging with a resolution of \textasciitilde 100 nm or better) are presented.},

Despite its many advantages, one major drawback of magnetic resonance is its relatively poor sensitivity and, as a consequence, its bad spatial resolution when examining heterogeneous samples. Contemporary science and technology often make use of very small amounts of material and examine heterogeneity on a very small length scale, both of which are well beyond the current capabilities of conventional magnetic resonance. It is therefore very important to significantly improve both the sensitivity and the spatial resolution of magnetic resonance techniques. The quest for higher sensitivity led in recent years to the development of many alternative detection techniques that seem to rival and challenge the conventional “old-fashioned” induction-detection approach. The aim of this manuscript is to briefly review recent advances in the field, and to provide a quantitative as well as qualitative comparison between various detection methods with an eye to future potential advances and developments. We first offer a common definition of sensitivity in magnetic resonance to enable proper quantitative comparisons between various detection methods. Following that, up-to-date information about the sensitivity capabilities of the leading recently-developed detection approaches in magnetic resonance is provided, accompanied by a critical comparison between them and induction detection. Our conclusion from this comparison is that induction detection is still indispensable, and as such, it is very important to look for ways to significantly improve it. To do so, we provide expressions for the sensitivity of induction-detection, derived from both classical and quantum mechanics, that identify its main limiting factors. Examples from current literature, as well as a description of new ideas, show how these limiting factors can be mitigated to significantly improve the sensitivity of induction detection. Finally, we outline some directions for the possible applications of high-sensitivity induction detection in the field of electron spin resonance.},

  abstract = {This paper represents a further generalization, beyond that given recently, of an earlier theory by Wangsness and the author. In common with this theory, it is assumed that the spin system is weakly coupled to its molecular surroundings and that the latter can be considered as a heat reservoir which remains in thermal equilibrium at the absolute temperature T. The condition that the coupling is weak demands that its effects upon the spin system, calculated in first and second approximation and measured in a frequency scale, are small compared to the inverse of the correlation time τc as well as of the time β=ℏkT. The principal progress over the earlier work consists in the fact that it imposes no additional conditions upon the energy of the spin system; in particular, it dispenses with the necessity that the dominant part of this energy is independent of the time. A linear differential equation of the first order for the distribution matrix is derived which is valid in this very general case and which contains the earlier results as special cases. The derivation of this Boltzmann equation is carried out in a form which is independent of any particular representation, used for the spin system, and which leads directly to a system of differential equations for the expectation values of spin functions. Beyond the earlier results, it is shown that the coupling with the molecular surroundings leads in second approximation not only to relaxation terms but also to a correction of the spin energy which has the nature of a "self-energy." As a considerably more restricted case, the situation is investigated where the dominant part of the spin energy varies little during a time of order τc and β. It is shown that, in this case, relaxation causes the distribution matrix to tend towards the form, corresponding to thermal equilibrium at the instantaneous value of the dominant part of the energy. The case where the frequencies of the spin system as well as their relative rate of variation are small compared to 1τc but arbitrary compared to 1β, is likewise discussed and shown to lead to a simple form of the Boltzmann equation. The general formalism is finally applied to a spin system with a single spin of value ½, exposed to a rotating field. One obtains in this case a phenomenological equation for the expectation value of the spin vector which is far more general than the one derived earlier; instead of requiring merely the knowledge of the longitudinal and the transverse relaxation time, relaxation is here characterized by five time constants which may all be different. The stationary solution is derived and applied to a number of familiar special cases.},

  abstract = {Approach for in vivo real-time assessment of tumor tissue extracellular pH (pHe), redox, and intracellular glutathione based on L-band EPR spectroscopy using dual function pH and redox nitroxide probe and disulfide nitroxide biradical, is described. These parameters were monitored in PyMT mice bearing breast cancer tumors during treatment with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. It was observed that tumor pHe is about 0.4 pH units lower than that in normal mammary gland tissue. Treatment with granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor decreased the value of pHe by 0.3 units compared with PBS control treatment. Tumor tissue reducing capacity and intracellular glutathione were elevated compared with normal mammary gland tissue. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor treatment resulted in a decrease of the tumor tissue reducing capacity and intracellular glutathione content. In addition to spectroscopic studies, pHe mapping was performed using recently proposed variable frequency proton–electron double-resonance imaging. The pH mapping superimposed with MRI image supports probe localization in mammary gland/tumor tissue, shows high heterogeneity of tumor tissue pHe and a difference of about 0.4 pH units between average pHe values in tumor and normal mammary gland. In summary, the developed multifunctional approach allows for in vivo, noninvasive pHe, extracellular redox, and intracellular glutathione content monitoring during investigation of various therapeutic strategies for solid tumors.

Inclusion of ringdown suppression in numerical pulse optimizations significantly reduces spectrometer deadtime when using high quality factor (high-Q) resonators, leading to increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and sensitivity of inductive measurements. To demonstrate the method, we experimentally measure the free-induction decay of an inhomogeneously broadened solid-state free radical spin system at high Q. The measurement is enabled by using a numerically optimized bandwidth-limited \{OCT\} pulse, including ringdown suppression, robust to variations in static and microwave field strengths. We also discuss the applications of pulse design in high-Q resonators to universal control of anisotropic-hyperfine coupled electron-nuclear spin systems via electron-only modulation even when the bandwidth of the resonator is significantly smaller than the hyperfine coupling strength. These results demonstrate how limitations imposed by linear response theory may be vastly exceeded when using a sufficiently accurate system model to optimize pulses of high complexity.},

  abstract = {In rapid scan EPR the rapidly-changing magnetic field induces a background signal that may be larger than the EPR signal. A method has been developed to correct for that background signal by acquiring two sets of data, denoted as scan 1 and scan 2. In scan 2 the external field B0 is reversed and the data acquisition trigger is offset by one half cycle of the scan field relative to the settings used in scan 1. For data acquired with a cross-loop resonator subtraction of scan 2 from scan 1 cancels the background and enhances the EPR signal. Experiments were performed at an EPR frequency of about 258\,MHz, which is in the range that is commonly used for in vivo imaging. Samples include nitroxide radicals, a trityl radical, a dinitroxide, and a nitroxide in the presence of a magnetic field gradient. This method has the advantage that no assumption is made about the shape of the background signal, and it provides an approach to automating the background correction.},

In many cases, these metal ions serve as useful spectrochemical probes of molecular structure, electron transfer, and enzyme kinetics (Vallee and Williams, 1968; Vallee and Wacker, 1970; Ochiai, 1977; Hughes, 1972; Eichhorn and Marzilli, 1979). Often the native metal (frequently zinc) can be removed and another metal ion substituted which has different and sometimes more desirable spectroscopic properties. By judicious choice of substitute metal ion to match particular technique, e.g., nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), Mössbauer, optical absorption, or electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, much can be learned about the metal binding site and its role in the function of the protein.},

Lubrication oil degradation strongly correlates with the concentration of stable free radicals caused by hydrocarbon chain decomposition due to heating. For the prototype spectrometer, the amplitude shift in a marginal oscillator output detects ESR absorption in a sample. The spectrometer’s spin sensitivity of 2.3~×~1014 spins for a used oil sample was achieved using the marginal oscillator with a loop-gap resonator. For the prototype spectrometer, the oscillation frequency was 2.09~GHz. The volume of the prototype spectrometer was 1.3 L, including a permanent magnet, microwave circuits, and digital communication circuitry on printed circuit boards. The weight of the spectrometer setup was 1.45~kg. This prototype spectrometer successfully detected the ESR signal from a 50~μL oil sample (spin concentration 8.3 x1019 spins/L) with a signal-to-noise ratio of 37 and an acquisition time of 30~s.},

Rotational correlation times τ c of spin probes and the intermolecular spin exchange rate constants k e were measured from EPR spectra at different temperatures and TEMPOL concentrations, and compared with the published data. The τ c values were calculated both by known equations and from the EPR spectra simulation. Rotation movements of TEMPOL in omimBF4 cannot be described by the model of the isotropic Brownian diffusion, which is valid for conventional solvents. The correct modeling of EPR spectra in RTIL can be achieved with the assumption of different rotational mobility of the spin probe around different molecular axes. The rotational, D rot, and translational, D tr, diffusion coefficients were calculated from τ c and k e values. The Debye–Stokes–Einstein law is valid in all three solvents while the dependence of D tr on T/η is not linear in Stokes–Einstein coordinates. The effective activation energy E rot a of the rotational movements in omimBF4 is noticeably higher than the corresponding values for conventional solvents, while the effective activation energies E tr a of the translational movements are comparable in all solvents studied.},

In contrast to our previous oscillator-based ESR detectors, where the ESR signal was encoded in the oscillation frequency, in the amplitude-sensitive method, the ESR signal is sensed as a change of the oscillation amplitude of the VCO. Therefore, using VCO architecture with a built-in amplitude demodulation scheme, the experimental setup reduces to a single permanent magnet in combination with a few inexpensive electronic components. We present a theoretical analysis of the achievable limit of detection, which uses perturbation-theory-based VCO modeling for the signal and applies a stochastic averaging approach to obtain a closed-form expression for the noise floor. Additionally, the paper also introduces a numerical model suitable for simulating oscillator-based ESR experiments in a conventional circuit simulator environment. This model can be used to optimize sensor performance early on in the design phase. Finally, all presented models are verified against measured results from a prototype VCO operating at 14 GHz inside a 0.5 T magnetic field.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy of paramagnetic species in single crystals is a powerful tool for characterizing the latter’s magnetic interaction parameters in detail. Conventional ESR systems are optimized for millimeter-size samples and make use of cavities and resonators that accommodate tubes and capillaries in the range 1-5 mm. Unfortunately, in the case of many interesting materials such as enzymes and inorganic catalytic materials (e.g., zeolites), single crystals can only be obtained in micron-scale sizes (1-200 µm). To boost ESR sensitivity and to enable experiments on microcrystals, the ESR resonator needs to be adapted to the size and shape of these specific samples. Here, we present a unique family of miniature surface resonators, known as “ParPar” resonators, whose mode volume and shape are optimized for such micron-scale single crystals. This approach significantly improves upon the samples’ filling factor and thus enables the measurement of much smaller crystals than was previously possible. We present here the design of such resonators with a typical mode dimension of 20-50 µm, as well as details about their fabrication and testing methods. The devices’ resonant mode(s) are characterized by ESR microimaging and compared to the theoretical calculations. Moreover, experimental ESR spectra of single microcrystals with typical sizes of ∼25-50 µm are presented. The measured spin sensitivity for the 50-µm resonator at cryogenic temperatures of 50 K is found to be ∼1.8 × 106 spins/G √Hz for a Cu-doped single crystal sample that is representative of many biological samples of relevance.},

  abstract = {Free radicals are thought to be key intermediates in the oxidation of wine, but their nature has not been established. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to detect and identify several free radical species in wine under oxidative conditions with the aid of spin traps. The 1-hydroxylethyl radical was the sole radical species observed when α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone was used as a spin trap in a heated (55 °C), low-sulfite (15 mg L−1) red wine. This radical appears to arise from ethanol oxidation via the hydroxyl radical, and this latter species was confirmed by using a high concentration (1.5 M) of the 5,5-dimethylpyrroline-N-oxide spin trap, thus providing the first direct evidence of the Fenton reaction in wine. Hydroxyl radical formation in wine was corroborated by converting hydroxyl radicals to methyl radicals by its reaction with dimethyl sulfoxide. The novel spin trap 5-tert-butoxycarbonyl 5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide was also used in this study to identify sulfite radicals in wine for the first time. This spin trap has also been shown to trap hydroperoxyl radicals, the generation of which is predicted in wine; however, no evidence of this species was observed.},

  abstract = {Li-ion battery technology has become very important in recent years as these batteries show great promise as power sources that can lead us to the electric vehicle (EV) revolution. The development of new materials for Li-ion batteries is the focus of research in prominent groups in the field of materials science throughout the world. Li-ion batteries can be considered to be the most impressive success story of modern electrochemistry in the last two decades. They power most of today's portable devices, and seem to overcome the psychological barriers against the use of such high energy density devices on a larger scale for more demanding applications, such as EV. Since this field is advancing rapidly and attracting an increasing number of researchers, it is important to provide current and timely updates of this constantly changing technology. In this review, we describe the key aspects of Li-ion batteries: the basic science behind their operation, the most relevant components, anodes, cathodes, electrolyte solutions, as well as important future directions for R\&D of advanced Li-ion batteries for demanding use, such as EV and load-leveling applications.},

A difference spectrum is constructed between the integrated first harmonic, in-phase, absorption spectrum (V0) and the first harmonic, 90° out-of-phase, dispersion spectrum (U′1), which gives a direct measure of the degree of reduction in intensity in the saturation transfer spectrum, arising from molecular rotation. Rotational correlation time calibrations are deduced from the dispersion mode difference spectra of spin-labeled hemoglobin in glycerol-water solutions of varying viscosity. The calibrations are presented as line heights or integrated sectional areas of the difference spectra, for the three diagnostic regions sensitive to axial and off axial rotations. Normalization is made relative to the V0 absorption spectra. The method is applied to the study of anisotropic rotation of a phospholipid spin label in gel phase phospholipid bilayer membranes.},

  abstract = {Exposure to particulate silica (most crystalline polymorphs) causes a persistent inflammation sustained by the release of oxidants in the alveolar space. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which include hydroxyl radical, superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and singlet oxygen, are generated not only at the particle surface, but also by phagocytic cells attempting to digest the silica particle. Two distinct kinds of surface centers—silica-based surface radicals and poorly coordinated iron ions—generate O2•− and HO• in aqueous solution via different mechanisms. Crystalline silica is also a potent stimulant of the respiratory burst in phagocytic cells with increased oxygen consumption and production of O•−, H2O2, and \{NO\} leading to acute inflammation and HO• generation in the lung. Oxidative stress elicited by crystalline silica is also evidenced by increased expression of antioxidant enzymes such as manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase, and the enzyme inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Generation of oxidants by crystalline silica particles and by silica-activated cells results in cell and lung injury, activation of cell signaling pathways to include MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation, increased expression of inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factorα [TNFα], interleukin-1 [IL-1]), and activation of specific transcription factors (e.g., NFκB, AP-1). Silica can also initiate apoptosis in response to oxygen- and nitrogen-based free radicals, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, increased gene expression of death receptors, and/or their ligands (TNFα, Fas ligand [FasL]).},

  abstract = {In this study, the effect of α-alumina (α-Al2O3) and γ-alumina (γ-Al2O3) on the precipitation of the positive electrolyte, which is one of the most important problems in vanadium redox battery (VRB) systems, was investigated. α-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3 were used as additive materials to improve the thermal stability of V(V) ion and the performance of VRB at high temperatures. Cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy were used to determine the properties of positive electrolyte systems. The optimum amount of additives was identified as wt\% 0.004 and 0.010 for α-Al2O3 and γ-Al2O3, respectively. The surface morphology and composition of electrodes were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. A plausible reaction mechanism was also proposed for redox reaction occurring on the positive electrode of a VRB. The adsorption of V(V) ions to the electrode surface from the solution increased by the time additives were added into the system. γ-Al2O3 showed the best anti-precipitation effects for the V(V) ion at 40~°C and 60~°C in the precipitation tests. In the battery test, the discharge capacity of γ-Al2O3 with a positive electrolyte, was the highest at 87.2~mAh. According to thermal and electrochemical studies, γ-Al2O3 can be a useful additive for the positive electrolyte of a VRB.},

The proposed chip contains an array of 14 injection-locked VCOs as the sensing element for an improved sensitive volume and phase noise performance. By cointegrating a high-bandwidth PLL, the presented design allows for continuous-wave and rapid-scan EPR experiments with a minimum number of external components. The active loop filter introduces an assisted replica charge pump that mitigates the slewing requirements on the loop-filter amplifier. The measured spin sensitivity of 2×109 spins/\$\textbackslash sqrt \textbackslash textHz \$ together with the large active volume of 210 nl lead to an 8-fold improvement in concentration sensitivity compared to the state-of-the-art in EPRoC detectors.},

Similar signal-to-noise ratios were obtained with conventional field modulation and the FM method, and a low-quality factor EPR resonator was not necessary to suppress the significant microwave reflection from the resonator. The FM method with a tunable resonator may be an alternative solution to achieving phase-sensitive detection, when the side-effects of magnetic field modulation, such as microphonic noise and mechanical vibration, are detrimental for EPR detection.},

The first-derivative spectrum of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) powder was measured with this FM method. Frequency modulation of up to 1.6MHz (peak-to-peak) was achieved at a microwave carrier frequency of 1.1GHz. This corresponds to a magnetic field modulation of 57μT (peak-to-peak) at 40.3mT. By using a tunable microwave resonator and automatic control systems, we achieved a practical continuous-wave (CW) EPR spectrometer that incorporates the FM method. In the present experiments, the EPR signal intensity was proportional to the magnitude of frequency modulation. The background signal at the modulation frequency (1kHz) for EPR detection was also proportional to the magnitude of frequency modulation. An automatic matching control (AMC) system reduced the amplitude of noise in microwave detection and improved the baseline stability. Distortion of the spectral lineshape was seen when the spectrometer settings were not appropriate, e.g., with a lack of the open-loop gain in automatic tuning control (ATC). FM is an alternative to field modulation when the side-effect of field modulation is detrimental for EPR detection. The present spectroscopic technique based on the FM scheme is useful for measuring the first derivative with respect to the microwave frequency in investigations of electron-spin-related phenomena.},

  abstract = {Abstract In portions of the magnetic resonance community, there is a misunderstanding of the process of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signal generation and reception, and even in accepted texts, it is frequently described in terms of absorption and emission of radio waves, or radiation, by a two‐level quantum system. While this explanation can be refuted, for those who do understand that the NMR free induction decay signal is easily explained by Faraday's law of induction, reconciling the presence of an induced electromotive force with an apparent absence of transitions between nuclear energy levels causes conceptual problems. This difficulty is examined, and an explanation of the signal given whereby Faraday's law is explained simply in terms of an exchange of virtual photons. The article thus attempts to reconcile the standard engineering approach to signal reception with a quantum mechanical description of the NMR phenomenon. Radiation damping and its relations to detection of the induced signal and to signal‐to‐noise ratio are then scrutinized, and the misleading nature of the appellation noted. In the process, it is shown that while damping is inherently necessary for signal detection and the transfer of energy that it entails, the degree of such damping depends on the efficiency of the detector—in other words, of the preamplifier in the NMR receiver—and can therefore be minimized. Mathematics in the article is kept to a minimum; proofs of the Principle of Reciprocity description of Faraday's law for reception of both signal and noise from a conducting sample are given in an appendix. ©1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

A simple and easily reproduced bench experiment that validates the principle is therefore described.

Using these equations, the reader is then guided through the steps needed to deduce correctly the signal received in an NMR experiment.

  abstract = {A detailed analysis of line shapes and relaxation is made for the perdeuterated 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-piper- idone AT-oxide (PD-Tempone) nitroxide radical covering the whole range from fast motional narrowing (tr \textasciitilde{}  10-12 sec) to the rigid limit (tr  \textasciitilde{}  10-6 sec) in several deuterated solvents. The slow tumbling results show particularly good agreement with the slow tumbling theory of Freed, et ai, for a reorientational model of moderate jumps (ca. 50° rms), and essentially isotropic reorientation. It is shown that while such a model may not be readily distinguished, purely from its slow tumbling spectral predictions, from a free diffusion model including inertial effects, the latter model is incompatible with most other considerations. However, a simple analysis explicitly including the fluctuating (or random) torques indicates that more fundamental analysis of the dynamics may explain the slow tumbling results without necessarily involving substantial jumps. The spectral analysis is considerably enhanced by the increased resolution obtained from the use of the perdeuterated spin probe and deuterated solvents. Careful analysis of results at X-band and 35 GHz has shown that the nonsecular spectral densities exhibit significant deviations from a Debye- like spectral density yielding results very similar to those recently reported for the peroxylaminedisulfon- ate (PADS) radical. Related observations are discussed of apparent non-Debye-like spectral densities in the incipient slow tumbling spectra. These anomalies are also found to be amenable to a unified explana- tion in terms of the fluctuating torques. The analysis of much of the results in terms of a simple model yields an rms value for the fluctuating torques of ca, V6kT and tm  \textasciitilde{}  tr where tm is the relaxation time of the torques. The high-temperature electron-spin flip processes are consistent with a Hubbard-type spin- rotational mechanism, but the low-temperature results may be due to spin-rotational relaxation from in- tramolecular motions. The simple analysis of spin-rotational relaxation in terms of relaxation of the fluc- tuating torques is found to yield equivalent predictions to conventional treatments when the estimated values of rms torque and tm are used.},

  abstract = {The hypothesis is made that the dispersion electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum can yield a higher signal-to-noise ratio than the absorption spectrum in diagnostic examinations if phase noise in the bridge is under control. The rationale for this hypothesis is based on the observation that the dispersion spectrum becomes more intense than the absorption spectrum at high incident powers. The rationale is dependent on optimization of high microwave efficiency (Λ; mT/W1/2) and low-quality factor (Q-value) sample~resonators as well as the use of microwave sources with reduced phase noise. Microwave frequencies from 1.2 to 94~GHz are considered. Although the dispersion display appears to be observable with an adequate signal-to-noise ratio for most EPR research initiatives, a weakness of microwave bridges for studies at high incident microwave power was identified. Spurious leakage of incident microwave power through the circulator, thereby bypassing the probe leading to the resonator, can result in a decreased signal-to-noise ratio in both absorption and dispersion because of phase noise. For dispersion EPR with low Q-value sample resonators, this leakage is the primary contributor to phase noise at the receiver. In this work, we focus on the design of microwave reflection bridges and discuss possible methods to ameliorate this source of noise.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a novel experiment on nitroxide radical spin labels using a multiarm EPR W-band bridge with a loop-gap resonator (LGR). We demonstrate EPR spectroscopy of spin labels by linear sweep of the microwave frequency across the spectrum. The high bandwidth of the LGR, about 1 GHz between 3 dB points of the microwave resonance, makes this new experiment possible. A frequency-tunable yttrium iron garnet (YIG) oscillator provides sweep rates as high as 1.8 × 105 GHz/s, which corresponds to 6.3 kT/s in magnetic field-sweep units over a 44 MHz range. Two experimental domains were identified. In the first, linear frequency sweep rates were relatively slow, and pure absorption and pure dispersion spectra were obtained. This appears to be a practical mode of operation at the present level of technological development. The main advantage is the elimination of sinusoidal magnetic field modulation. In the second mode, the frequency is swept rapidly across a portion of the spectrum, and then the frequency sweep is stopped for a readout period; FID signals from a swept line oscillate at a frequency that is the difference between the spectral position of the line in frequency units and the readout position. If there is more than one line, oscillations are superimposed. The sweep rates using the YIG oscillator were too slow, and the portion of the spectrum too narrow to achieve the full EPR equivalent of Fourier transform (FT) NMR. The paper discusses technical advances required to reach this goal. The hypothesis that trapezoidal frequency sweep is an enabling technology for FT EPR is supported by this study.},

Spectra of lithium phthalocyanine (LiPc) needles (T1=8 μs,T2=3.4 μs) and of a 0.2 mM aqueous solution of Nycomed triarylmethyl (trityl-CD3) radical (T1=11.5 μs,T2=8 μs) were recorded at scan rates between 3.4·103 and 7.5·105 G/s at the center of sinusoidal scans. Signals for LiPc were obtained with a split-ring resonator, a rectangular resonator and a dielectric resonator. At faster scan rates the small bandwidth of the high-Q dielectric resonator filters, out high-frequency components of the rapid-scan signals. Field inhomogeneities induced by the rapidly changing magnetic field increase with scan rate and are greater with the dielectric and split-ring resonantors than with the rectangular resonator. Data for trityl-CD3 were recorded with the rectangular resonator. The extended trityl sample, about 3 mm long, shows larger effects of magnetic field inhomogeneities than the small LiPc crystals.},

  abstract = {When the modulation frequency used in continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (cw EPR) spectroscopy exceeds the linewidth, modulation sidebands appear in the spectrum. It is shown theoretically and experimentally that these sidebands are actually multiple photon transitions, σ++k×π, where one microwave (mw) σ+ photon is absorbed from the mw radiation field and an arbitrary number k of radio frequency (rf) π photons are absorbed from or emitted to the modulation rf field. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that both the derivative shape of the lines in standard cw EPR spectra and the distortions due to overmodulation are caused by the unresolved sideband pattern of these lines. The single-photon transition does not even give a contribution to the first-harmonic cw EPR signal. Multiple photon transitions are described semiclassically in a toggling frame and their existence is proven using second quantization. With the toggling frame approach and perturbation theory an effective Hamiltonian for an arbitrary sideband transition is derived. Based on the effective Hamiltonians an expression for the steady-state density operator in the singly rotating frame is derived, completely describing all sidebands in all modulation frequency harmonics of the cw EPR signal. The relative intensities of the sidebands are found to depend in a very sensitive way on the actual rf amplitude and the saturation of single sidebands is shown to depend strongly on the effective field amplitude of the multiple photon transitions. By comparison with the analogous solutions for frequency-modulation EPR it is shown that the field-modulation and the frequency-modulation technique are not equivalent. The experimental data fully verify the theoretical predictions with respect to intensities and lineshapes.},

  abstract = {A preliminary account is given of attempts to perform ELDOR spectroscopy utilizing a pulsed EPR spectrometer that operates in the saturation-recovery mode for measurements of electron spin-lattice relaxation times. The procedure is to saturate one of the hyperfine lines with a pulse of high microwave power, shift the magnetic field at the end of the microwave pulse within a time shorter than the electronic T1 to the resonant value of another hyperfine component, and measure the saturation transfer that has taken place by monitoring the EPR signal intensity as a function of time as in a conventional saturation-recovery experiment. The saturation transfer has been measured as a function of the microwave pulse width and the peak power of the saturating microwave pulse in order to establish that the extent of saturation transfer is related to the extent of saturation of the transition which was directly saturated in the first instance. The studies are carried out on 2,5-ditertiary butyl p-benzosemiquinone ion in ethanol. The lack of signal-averaging techniques in these preliminary experiments forces the use of a high free radical concentration (10−2M) leading to considerable overlap between hyperfine components-the spectral overlap aiding saturation transfer. However, these preliminary experiments have demonstrated the feasibility of the field-pulsed ELDOR method in the investigation of saturation transfer. By a minor modification of the pulsing circuit, it has been possible to obtain linear magnetic field scans of the order of 6 G at the maximum rate of 1 G/μsec. Since the spectrometer has a response time of the order of 3 μsec, it should be possible to obtain EPR spectra of transient species with lifetimes of the order of 10 μsec or longer by such rapid scan techniques.},

  abstract = {It is shown that the observed width of the microwave electron spin resonance absorption lines associated with F centers in KCl, NaCl, and KBr crystals can be attributed to hyperfine interactions between the F-center electron and the nuclear magnetic moments of the ions adjacent to the F center. The width arises from the distribution of nuclear moment components. Theoretical calculations of the width are in good agreement with observation provided that the F-center wave function is treated as a linear combination of atomic orbitals; wave functions calculated on continuum models are shown to be unsatisfactory. The theory is confirmed by a comparison of observations on F centers in crystals of K39Cl and K41Cl. If the width is attributed to interactions with the nearest sets of K and Cl ions, the experiments lead directly to quantitative values of the electronic charge density at the K and Cl nuclei: one finds |Ψ(K)|2=0.70×1024 cm−3 and |Ψ(Cl)|2=0.12×1024 cm−3.},

The echo-detected (ED) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) lineshape reveals strong dependence on the time interval τ between the echo-forming microwave pulses which is readily explained by anisotropic phase relaxation. Employing a librational model of molecular motion and the Redfield relaxation theory, spectra were simulated for the τ's varying in a large interval. The anisotropic relaxation rate increases with temperature increase and it is larger for nitroxide with a larger molecular size. The mean-squared amplitude of motion, obtained from reduced hyperfine splitting in continuous-wave EPR, near Tg linearly depends on temperature which is characteristic of harmonic solids. For tempone in a host crystal 2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-cyclobutan-1, 3-dione the anisotropic spin relaxation rate decreases with temperature increase so the found feature solely belongs to a glassy state. A new approach is proposed for modeling slow wobbling motion in a restricted angular space.},

A microstrip line was used to inductively couple MWs into the resonator. We characterised the proposed resonator topology by electromagnetic (EM) field simulations, a field perturbation method, as well as by return loss measurements.

Spectra of arrestin spin-labeled at site 267 were recorded at room temperature as a function of microwave power. The separation of irradiating microwave frequencies, Δf, was 10kHz, and a newly-designed multiquantum Q-band electron paramagnetic resonance bridge was utilized, operating in a superheterodyne detection mode. The sample volume was 30nL using a 3-loop–2-gap resonator. Most spectra were obtained at a 300μM concentration in single, 2-min scans, but spectra were also successfully obtained at 30μM, corresponding to one picomole of protein. Enhanced sensitivity to T1 and T2 was evident in the spectra, and linewidths varied considerably across the spectra. The pure absorption displays are beneficial relative to field modulation methods for spectral characterization. The presence of two states of the nitroxide spin-label with different relaxation times is evident, particularly in the dispersion spectra, which are expected to exhibit enhanced sensitivity to lineshape variation relative to absorption. Feasibility has been established for the use of this technique for site-directed spin-labeling studies of biologically relevant samples, particularly the study of protein structure and dynamics.},

In this work we introduce a method for EPR-based pH mapping utilizing a method of spectral-spatial imaging of sequentially scanned spectra to decrease the missing gradient rotation angle, without increasing the spatial field of view. Repeated in vitro measurements of pH phantom tubes demonstrated higher precision measurements of the hyperfine coupling constant (HFC) compared to previous EPR-based methods, resulting in mean pH values accurate to less than 0.1 pH across a range of physiologically observed values.},

  abstract = {After a brief summary of the ideas underlying the quantum theory of dispersion it is shown that it can be applied to the refraction of x-rays, although the assumption that the number of atoms in a wave length cube is large is no longer satisfied. A general formula for the index of refraction in terms of the atomic absorption coefficient α and the critical frequencies is given. From the condition, experimentally verified, that the electrons in the atom for impressed frequencies, large compared to their natural frequencies, shall act like free electrons as far as the index of refraction is concerned, a relation is obtained for α. From the failure of this relation when applied to the groups of electrons separately, conclusions are drawn as to the coupling of the groups. Some considerations on the origin of the Compton shifted radiation are added, from which it appears that in the wave description this radiation must be regarded as coming from all the atoms and as being coherent with the incident waves; a result suited to stress the difficulty of harmonizing the wave picture with that of quantum processes in the atoms.1},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is the method of choice to investigate and quantify paramagnetic species in many scientific fields, including materials science and the life sciences. Common EPR spectrometers use electromagnets and microwave (MW) resonators, limiting their application to dedicated lab environments. Here, novel aspects of voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based EPR-on-a-Chip (EPRoC) detectors are discussed, which have recently gained interest in the EPR community. More specifically, it is demonstrated that with a VCO-based EPRoC detector, the amplitude-sensitive mode of detection can be used to perform very fast rapid-scan EPR experiments with a comparatively simple experimental setup to improve sensitivity compared to the continuous-wave regime. In place of a MW resonator, VCO-based EPRoC detectors use an array of injection-locked VCOs, each incorporating a miniaturized planar coil as a combined microwave source and detector. A striking advantage of the VCO-based approach is the possibility of replacing the conventionally used magnetic field sweeps with frequency sweeps with very high agility and near-constant sensitivity. Here, proof-of-concept rapid-scan EPR (RS-EPRoC) experiments are performed by sweeping the frequency of the EPRoC VCO array with up to 400 THz s\textsuperscript{−1}, corresponding to a field sweep rate of 14 kT s\textsuperscript{−1}. The resulting time-domain RS-EPRoC signals of a micrometer-scale BDPA sample can be transformed into the corresponding absorption EPR signals with high precision. Considering currently available technology, the frequency sweep range may be extended to 320 MHz, indicating that RS-EPRoC shows great promise for future sensitivity enhancements in the rapid-scan regime.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {It is well established that the formation of radical species centered on various atoms is involved in the mechanism leading to the development of several diseases or to the appearance of deleterious effects of toxic molecules. The detection of free radical is possible using Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and the spin trapping technique. The classical EPR spin-trapping technique can be considered as a “hypothesis-driven” approach because it requires an a priori assumption regarding the nature of the free radical in order to select the most appropriate spin-trap. We here describe a “data-driven” approach using EPR and a cocktail of spin-traps. The rationale for using this cocktail was that it would cover a wide range of biologically relevant free radicals and have a large range of hydrophilicity and lipophilicity in order to trap free radicals produced in different cellular compartments. As a proof-of-concept, we validated the ability of the system to measure a large variety of free radicals (O-, N-, C-, or S- centered) in well characterized conditions, and we illustrated the ability of the technique to unambiguously detect free radical production in cells exposed to chemicals known to be radical-mediated toxic agents.},

  abstract = {Interest on nanometric conformal coatings is currently growing across a wide range of applications, from electronic components to corrosion protection, chemical barriers or even wear decrease. Currently, atomic layer deposition (ALD) is one of the most promising nanometric deposition technologies: it offers the possibility to obtain conformal coatings even on very complex tridimensional substrates, with a strict thickness tolerance. During an ALD cycle, only one molecular layer is deposited on the substrate surface, enabling the theoretical possibility to tailor the composition of the deposit up to molecular resolution. In the first part of this review, a brief history of ALD is presented to better understand the evolution of the technique during the past five decades; in the second part, a short description of the main ALD techniques is given, considering their main advantages and drawbacks. In the third part, a short review about ALD applications is presented, and in the fourth part the most useful and used instruments for the analysis and characterization of ALD are listed; some results are discussed and particular emphasis on the corrosion protection of different metallic alloys of common industrial interest is given.},

For other lineshapes, earlier papers in this series have shown that the direction and magnitude of the displacement of DISPA data from a reference circle (diameter equal to maximum absorption peak height) is characteristic of the line-broadening mechanism. In this paper, power saturation is shown to displace DISPA data symmetrically outside the reference circle. Adjacent peaks produce DISPA displacement that is detectable even for large peak separation (25 linewidths for a symmetrical doublet; 7 to 8 linewidths for the central line of a symmetrical triplet). Finally, a distribution in peak position is dominant over a distribution in linewidth in determining DISPA displacement. The DISPA plot shapes for these and 12 other line-broadening mechanisms are summarized in convenient reference form.},

Appli- cations to studies of the transverse polarity profiles in lipid bilayers, which con- stitute the permeability barrier of biological membranes, are reviewed. Emphasis is given to parallels with the permeation profiles of oxygen and nitric oxide that are determined from spin-label relaxation enhancements by using nonlinear continuous- wave EPR and saturation recovery EPR, and with permeation profiles of D2O that are determined by using 2H electron spin echo envelope modulation spectroscopy.},

T1 values at 4.2~K are in the µs range which is orders of magnitude faster than for 3d transition metals. Phase memory times, Tm, are less than 500~ns, which is short relative to values observed for 3d transition metals and organic radicals at 4~K. Tm is longer in the oxalate lattice which is attributed to the lower proton concentration in oxalate than in the organic solvent, which decreases nuclear spin diffusion. The rigidity of the crystalline lattice also may contribute to longer Tm.},

  abstract = {The advantages of rapid-scan EPR relative to CW and pulse techniques for samples with long longitudinal relaxation time T1 (Ns0 defects in diamond, N@C60, and amorphous hydrogenated silicon), heterogeneous samples (crystalline 1:1 α,γ-bisdiphenylene-β-phenylallyl (BDPA):benzene), lossy samples (aqueous nitroxyl radicals), and transient radicals (5-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (BMPO)-superoxide adduct) were studied. For samples with long relaxation times, CW (continuous wave) EPR is challenging due to power saturation and distortions from passage effects. In rapid-scan EPR, the field is swept through resonance in a time that is short relative to T2. In rapid-scan EPR, the magnetic field is on resonance for a short time relative to CW EPR. Because of this, the energy absorbed by the spins, for the same microwave B1, is less than in conventional CW spectra, and the signal does not saturate as readily. For samples with long electron relaxation times, pulse techniques can also be challenging, particularly if T2 is long and T2* is short. Rapid-scan EPR is a powerful alternative to CW and pulse EPR because it is a straight-forward technique that does not require the high power of pulse EPR. For the samples studied, improvements in signal-to-noise ranging from factors of 10 to 250 were observed. Rapid-scan can also be used to extract relaxation information from a sample. The rapid-scan spectra for lithium phthalocyanine (LiPc) and 15N-PDT (4-oxo-2,2,6,6-tetra-perdeuteromethyl-piperidinyl-15N-oxyl-d16) were simulated to determine T2. The extraction of T2 from the rapid-scan spectra of BDPA was also attempted. Through our difficulty in simulating the rapid-scan spectra of BDPA, we realized that commercial BDPA was not a homogeneous sample. The experiments studying BDPA demonstrated that rapid-scan experiments can give insight into the relaxation of a sample that might not otherwise be evident with conventional CW EPR. Finally, rapid-scan EPR at X-band was applied to spin trapping experiments. Superoxide was generated by the reaction of xanthine oxidase and hypoxanthine and trapped with BMPO. Spin trapping with 5-tert-butoxycarbonyl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (BMPO) to form BMPO-OOH adduct converts the short-lived superoxide into a more stable spin adduct. The detection limit for spin-trapped superoxide was compared between CW and rapid-scan EPR. The signal-to-noise ratio was more than 40 times greater for rapid-scan than for CW EPR. We also demonstrated detection of superoxide produced by Enterococcus faecalis at rates that are too low for detection by CW EPR.},

Especially for highly reactive cyanoacrylates, better known as super glues, the adhesion mechanism is poorly understood because, among other things, the characterization of the interface is difficult. The aim of this work is to evaluate methods to produce nm-thin, homogeneous films of cyanoacrylate to enable spectroscopic analysis of the interface in the future. Two deposition techniques, thermal evaporation and spin coating, of ethyl-cyanoacrylate, are compared. Thickness and composition of the cured films are investigated by atomic force microscopy, laser scanning microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Thermal evaporation in ultra-high vacuum leads to cluster-like depositions and is therefore not suitable for interface analysis. Spin coating is strongly dependent on solvent and concentration. While the solvent tetrahydrofuran leads to porous and inhomogeneous films, spin coating with anisole as solvent provides homogeneous films of cyanoacrylate with a thickness of only 4 nm. This allows surface-sensitive analytical methods to access the interface and possible interactions can be characterized in-situ.},

The substitution of conventional metals as redox-active material by organic materials offers a promising alternative for the next generation of rechargeable batteries since these organic batteries are excelling in charging speed and cycling stability. This review provides a comprehensive overview of these systems and discusses the numerous classes of organic, polymer-based active materials as well as auxiliary components of the battery, like additives or electrolytes. Moreover, a definition of important cell characteristics and an introduction to selected characterization techniques is provided, completed by the discussion of potential socio-economic impacts.},

  abstract = {Many of the errors in EPR concentration measurements result from the inability of an analyst to use the reference sample that is identical to the sample to be analyzed in a number of substantial respects. Generally, it is not correct to compare directly the intensities of the signals from two samples that contain different paramagnetic centers, or are different in matrix material, dimensions, or position in the cavity. It is necessary to evaluate the resulting systematic errors and correct them. The paper is devoted to the analysis of the following sources of errors which frequently occur in such situations: nonuniformity of the cavity fields; different extent of microwave field perturbation by samples with different dielectric constants; inequality of the transition probabilities corresponding to the used spectral lines of the samples under comparison. Theoretical and semiempirical calculations enable one to determine the magnitudes of the errors from these sources and to obtain the appropriate correction factors in many specific cases.},

Beyond particle and nuclear physics experiments, dynamically polarized nuclei have been used for experiments involving structural studies of biomolecules by neutron scattering and by NMR spectroscopy. Emerging applications in MRI are also benefiting from the sensitivity and contrast enhancements made possible by DNP or other hyperpolarization techniques. Topics are introduced theoretically using language and terminology suitable for scientists and advanced students from a range of disciplines, making this an accessible resource to this interdisciplinary field.},

In an optimal situation, a balanced-distribution exists between oxidants and antioxidants among wines intrinsic/extrinsic metabolites. Based on the kinetic study of POBN-1-hydroxyethyl spin adduct (POBN-1-HER) formation in wines initiated via the Fenton reaction, a novel tool based on EPR spin trapping methodology was developed to quantify wines resistance against oxidation. Antioxidant capacities of wines were evaluated according to POBN-1-HER maximum signal intensity (Imax POBN-1-HER) and rate formation (rPOBN-1-HER) kinetic parameters. Low Imax POBN-1-HER and rPOBN-1-HER values suggest that endogenous antioxidants in wine are able to quench a substantial amount of radicals capable to take part in deleterious oxidative reactions. This will be very valuable in understanding aging potential and will provide an avenue to better control the process by knowing how it might be possible to change wines resistance against oxidation.},

  abstract = {The isotropic and anisotropic hyperfine coupling constants and g-values of the nitroxide spin label (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSSL) were determined from 9-GHz and 95-GHz electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements in various solvents with a large distribution in polarity and proticity. The parameters Aiso, giso, Azz, and gxx of MTSSL were found to be sensitive to changes in solvent properties, where A-values increased and g-values decreased due to increased solvent polarity or proticity. A linear correlation was found for the isotropic (giso, Aiso) and anisotropic (gxx, Azz) parameters, respectively. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the same parameters were performed for a model spin label with the possibility to vary the dielectric constant (ε) of the medium and the number of hydrogen bonds formed with the nitroxide oxygen. From a qualitative analysis of experimental and calculated results, it was possible to specify the causes of the parameter shifts in more detail. In the “apolar region” (ε {$<$} 25), the sensitivity of Aiso and Azz to ε is large. However, in the “polar region” (ε {$>$} 25), the sensitivity to ε is small, and the shifts in Aiso and Azz are mainly determined by the proticity of the solvent. Methanol was found to form ∼1 and water ∼2 hydrogen bonds to the nitroxide on average. The DFT method determined the shifts in giso and gxx due to hydrogen bonding more accurately compared with the restricted open-shell Hartree−Fock method. The anisotropic spin label-solvent data can be used in the interpretation of rigid-limit data from spin-labeled proteins to gain further insight in local environmental properties.},

  abstract = {Organic matter (OM) sources and transfers are critical questions at the crossroad of ecology, hydrology and paleoenvironmental studies in karst environments. Recently chemical or isotopic characterisations of these organic matters have demonstrated their diversity in karst water and speleothems. However, knowledge of their origin and transfer from soil needs to be improved especially in karst environments where a mosaic of soils occurs. Here we investigate the applicability of the Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) signature of OM to seek different soil fingerprints in speleothems. The positions and the shapes of semiquinone-type radical’s EPR lines are considered as a robust signature of the organic matter through the different compartment of karst ecosystems. We demonstrate that the combination of EPR lines simulation constitutes a fingerprint that discriminates folic Leptosol developed on limestone outcrops from eutric Cambisols located in the dolines and topographical depressions. We also report the conservation of the thinner OM EPR lines after a water extraction of the organic matter from soils. Finally, OM EPR signatures were detected in two different speleothems sampled near each other: a stalagmite and a subaqueous flowstone. An unexpected two-orders-of-magnitude discrepancy between the free radical concentrations of the subaqueous flowstone and the soils on one hand, and the low free radical concentration of the stalagmite samples on the other, was ascribed to the kinetics of conformational changes in OM occurring during their transfer through karst either in fast or in slow water pathways. A folic Leptosol fingerprint was found in stalagmite and conversely, an eutric Cambisol fingerprint was found in the flowstone sample. This unexpected difference between the EPR signatures of the flowstone sample and stalagmite sample was ascribed to the masking of the Leptosol EPR signature (due to the low concentrations of free radicals) in the case of the flowstone sample and to the fact that the EPR signature of the stalagmite sample clearly shows the Leptosol is the sole source of the OM. Finally, the folic Leptosol fingerprint remains steady over the last four centuries covered by the stalagmite demonstrating that the source of the OM is stable over the growth period strengthening the interest of OM entrapped in speleothem for paleoenvironment studies.},

For these materials, the resonance line is very broad and lies at low resonance field, so that only a part of the line can be detected experimentally. Moreover, the line is of asymmetric (Dysonian) shape as described by the line shape parameter . We have compared values of line parameters derived by computer fitting of the whole experimental EPR line to the Dyson function (or modified Dyson function) with the values obtained by applying this procedure to the left and the right half of the line.},

The measured saturation factor gives for F centers in KCl a spin-lattice relaxation time of 2.5×10−5 sec at room temperature. The observed saturation behavior in which only the absorption saturates is in marked disagreement with the Kramers-Kronig relations. However it is shown, that the Kramers-Kronig relations are not applicable to saturated systems. Expressions which avoid the use of these relations are presented for saturable systems.},

  abstract = {The specific energy of the vanadium redox battery is determined by the solubility of the four vanadium oxidation states in sulfuric acid. While recent studies have shown that a higher vanadium concentration than that initially proposed might be feasible, further reliable solubility data for the various vanadium ions is required if the electrolyte composition is to be properly optimized. This study describes the results of a solubility study of vanadyl sulfate in sulfuric acid. VOSO4 is the species which exists in the discharged positive half-cell of the vanadium redox cell. The solubility data have been generated in sulfuric acid concentrations that range from 0 to 9 mol/l and at temperatures between 10 and 50°C. The solubility of VOSO4 is found to decrease continuously with increasing H2SO4 concentration and decreasing temperature. At 20°C, the solubility of VOSO4 in distilled water is 3.280 mol/l whereas in 9 M H2SO4 it is 0.260 mol/l. The drop in solubility with increasing H2SO4 concentration is significant and is more pronounced at lower concentrations. A multivariable solubility prediction model has been developed as a function of temperature and total sulfate/bisulfate (SO42− and HSO4−) concentration using the extended Debye–Huckel functional form. The average absolute deviation of the predicted solubility values from experimental data is 4.5\% with a maximum deviation of about 12\% over the abovementioned temperature and sulfuric acid concentration range. When solubility data in the more useful H2SO4 concentration range of 3–7 M is considered, the solubility correlation improved with an average absolute deviation of only 3.0\% and a maximum deviation of about 7\%.},

  abstract = {In oxidative phosphorylation, complex I (NADH:quinone oxidoreductase) couples electron transfer to proton translocation across an energy-transducing membrane. Complex I contains a flavin mononucleotide to oxidize NADH, and an unusually long series of iron-sulfur (FeS) clusters, in several subunits, to transfer the electrons to quinone. Understanding coupled electron transfer in complex I requires a detailed knowledge of the properties of individual clusters and of the cluster ensemble, and so it requires the correlation of spectroscopic and structural data: This has proved a challenging task. EPR studies on complex I from Bos taurus have established that EPR signals N1b, N2 and N3 arise, respectively, from the 2Fe cluster in the 75 kDa subunit, and from 4Fe clusters in the PSST and 51 kDa subunits (positions 2, 7, and 1 along the seven-cluster chain extending from the flavin). The other clusters have either evaded detection or definitive signal assignments have not been established. Here, we combine double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy on B. taurus complex I with the structure of the hydrophilic domain of Thermus thermophilus complex I. By considering the magnetic moments of the clusters and the orientation selectivity of the DEER experiment explicitly, signal N4 is assigned to the first 4Fe cluster in the TYKY subunit (position 5), and N5 to the all-cysteine ligated 4Fe cluster in the 75 kDa subunit (position 3). The implications of our assignment for the mechanisms of electron transfer and energy transduction by complex I are discussed.},

Different approximations for the shapes and sizes of nuclear induction signals are derived for various limiting cases, depending (a) whether the passage of Hz is ` adiabatic ' or ` extremely non-adiabatic ' (very weak radio-frequency field) and (b) whether the relaxation times are shorter or longer than the period of the sweep of Hz. It is found that quite large signals may be induced by even a very weak radio-frequency field if the relaxation times are very long.},

  abstract = {Handheld pipettes are invaluable to scientists in labs across the globe. Due to high inaccuracies at volumes of less than 1 [mu]L, a nanoliter pipette could truly change the way people research. This experimental nanoliter pipette uses a regulating CAM mechanism and a diaphragm to displace small amounts of fluid. The CAM mechanism has the ability to be adjusted to different steps, each of which controls the amount of working fluid to be displaced in a sealed chamber. In response to this, the diaphragm displaces a smaller volumetric amount of fluid outside the chamber. A deamplification ratio is defined by the ratio of the volume displaced by the diaphragm to the volume displaced by the CAM mechanism. The deamplification ratio is adjustable by changing the setting of the variable CAM mechanism or exchanging different tip assemblies which hold different sized diaphragms. In all, this nanoliter pipette enables measuring and dispensing of very small volumes of liquid, ranging from I nL to 1[mu] L, and can expand the tools of every lab researcher internationally.},

  abstract = {Continuous-wave linewidths and spin susceptibilities, spin−spin relaxation rates (1/T2), and spin−lattice relaxation rates (1/T1) for two sources of x-LiPc were measured at 9.5 GHz between 15 and 298 K. Relaxation rates at 34 GHz were measured between 80 and 298 K. Room-temperature relaxation rates also were measured at 250 MHz, 1.9 GHz, and 2.76 GHz. The temperature dependences of linewidths and spin susceptibilities are characteristic of 1-D organic conductors. The ratio of populations of localized and delocalized electrons varies with sample preparation. For a single needle between 15 and about 200 K, 1/T2 is higher for the parallel orientation, but 1/T1 is higher for the perpendicular orientation, consistent with predictions based on dipolar interactions. Between about 60 and 150 K, which is the temperature regime in which spin susceptibility is changing rapidly with temperature, 1/T1 exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on temperature and is lower at 34 GHz than at 9.5 GHz. In other organic conductors, this dependence has been attributed to a bottleneck mechanism of relaxation. At higher temperatures, 1/T1 becomes less orientation-dependent. At room temperature, T1 increases rapidly between 250 MHz (3.0 μs) and 2.76 GHz (6.3 μs) and then shows less frequency dependence up to 34 GHz (9.8 μs). The relaxation rate near room temperature might have a substantial contribution from spin hopping perpendicular to the stacking axis of the molecules.},

Relaxation rates for polar nitroxyls also were measured in glassy sorbitol. Dependence on T where V eff is effective molecular volume and γ is a material-specific parameter, was used to compare processes. Values of V eff were determined based on molecular libration in glassy sucrose octaacetate (γ = 3.5), tumbling in viscous decalin at 233 K (γ = 4.7), or tumbling in heavy mineral oil (γ = 6.0). For nitroxyl relaxation there is a master curve: log(1/T 1) vs log( T) (γ = 0.89). The similarity of the values of γ for the Raman process and for the additional process that contributes at higher temperatures, and the absence of frequency dependence between X- and Q-band, support assignment of this additional process as a local mode. For these radicals the contributions from the local mode and the Raman process are correlated and follow trends in spin–orbit coupling. The temperature dependence of spin echo dephasing in sucrose octaacetate is dominated by rotation of methyl groups and by a motional process analogous to the Raman process.},

  abstract = {A technology center for the production of high-precision reflection gratings has been established. Within this project a new optics beamline and a versatile reflectometer for at-wavelength characterization of UV- and XUV-reflection gratings and other (nano-) optical elements has been set up at BESSY-II. The Plane Grating Monochromator beamline operated in collimated light (c-PGM) is equipped with an SX700 monochromator, of which the blazed gratings (600 and 1200\hspace{0.25em}lines\hspace{0.25em}mm               −1               ) have been recently exchanged for new ones of improved performance produced in-house. Over the operating range from 10 to 2000\hspace{0.25em}eV this beamline has very high spectral purity achieved by (i) a four-mirror arrangement of different coatings which can be inserted into the beam at different angles and (ii) by absorber filters for high-order suppression. Stray light and scattered radiation is removed efficiently by double sets of               in situ               exchangeable apertures and slits. By use of in- and off-plane bending-magnet radiation the beamline can be adjusted to either linear or elliptical polarization. One of the main features of a novel 11-axes reflectometer is the possibility to incorporate real life-sized gratings. The samples are adjustable within six degrees of freedom by a newly developed UHV-tripod system carrying a load up to 4\hspace{0.25em}kg, and the reflectivity can be measured between 0 and 90° incidence angle for both               s               - and               p               -polarization geometry. This novel powerful metrology facility has gone into operation recently and is now open for external users. First results on optical performance and measurements on multilayer gratings will be presented here.},

  abstract = {The design and performance of the first commercial 94 GHz continuous-wave (CW-)/Fourier transform (FT-) EPR and ENDOR spectrometer are described. The spectrometer design is based on a heterodyne microwave bridge using an X-band intermediate frequency (IF), a hybrid magnet system, a variable-temperature, top-loading TeraFlex probehead with a TE011 cavity as well as the ELEXSYS-line digital electronics and the Xepr software package. The W-band bridge can be driven by a CW- or pulse-IF unit and delivers a microwave power of 5 mW at 94 GHz. In pulse mode the power is sufficient for a π/2 pulse of 100 ns at a resonatorQ-value of 3000. The magnet system consists of a 6 T split-coil superconducting magnet and a water-cooled room-temperature coil. The main coil can be swept over the full range from 0 to 6 T. The room-temperature coil has a 800 G sweep range around the persistent field of the main magnet. The ENDOR probe features a tuned circuit for1H nuclei allowing an RF π-pulse of 8 𝜇s with a 200 W amplifier. A broad-band setup is used for other nuclei. The E680 FT-EPR system utilizes the PatternJet pulse programmer and the SpecJet high-speed transient signal averager. The concerted action of these two devices results in a pulse EPR sensitivity equal or higher than in CW-EPR. Selected examples indicating the performance of the 94 GHz CW/FT-EPR and ENDOR systems are shown.},

  abstract = {As a demonstration of the application of rapid-scan EPR to imaging at low frequency and magnetic field, a multi-compartment phantom containing six different samples was imaged. The samples were nitroxide radicals, trityl (substituted triarylmethyl) radicals, and the oxygen-sensitive solid lithium phthalocyanine (LiPc), all of which are useful for in vivo imaging. The 2D spectral-spatial image demonstration was performed at 250\,MHz, with samples in sealed tubes of various sizes arranged in a 3D-printed plastic holder. Maximum gradients of 10\,G/cm gave a spatial resolution of about 0.1\,mm for the narrow trityl and LiPc signals and about 1\,mm for the nitroxide. The importance of proper selection of resonator bandwidth and scan rate for obtaining accurate linewidth information is demonstrated for a case in which the phantom is composed of species with signal linewidths and relaxation times that differ by more than a factor of 10.},

Our setup suppresses source noise, can handle the high microwave powers typical in X-band pulsed EPR, and is compatible with the convenient resonator coupling and sample access found on commercially available spectrometers. Our approach allows standard pulsed and continuous-wave EPR experiments to be performed at X-band frequency with significantly increased sensitivity compared to the unmodified setup. The probehead demonstrates a voltage signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement by a factor close to 8× at a temperature of 6~K, and remains close to 2× at room temperature. By further suppressing room-temperature noise at the expense of reduced microwave power (and thus minimum π-pulse length), the factor of SNR improvement approaches 15 at 6~K, corresponding to an impressive 200-fold reduction in EPR measurement time. We reveal the full potential of this probehead by demonstrating such SNR improvements using a suite of typical hyperfine and dipolar spectroscopy experiments on exemplary samples.},

The collimated plane grating monochromator (PGM-) beamline at a bending magnet is setup at the BESSY-II synchrotron radiation facility within the framework of the blazed-grating production facility. Coupled to a versatile four-circle (ten axes) UHV- reflectometer as a permanent end station the whole setup is dedicated to at-wavelength characterization and calibration of the in-house produced precision gratings and novel nano-optical devices as well as mirrors, multilayered systems etc. It is also open to external projects employing reflectometry, spectroscopy or scattering techniques. According to its purpose, this beamline has specific features, such as: very high spectral purity, provided by two independent high order suppression systems, an advanced aperture system for suppression of stray light and scattered radiation, a broad energy range between 10 eV and 2000 eV, small beam divergence and spot size on the sample. Thus this Optics Beamline will become a powerful metrology tool for reflectivity measurements in s- or p-polarisation geometry with linearly or elliptically polarized light on real optics up to 360 mm length and 4 kg weight.},

Shaped broadband excitation pulses designed using optimal control theory (OCT) have been tested with this device at X-band frequency (9 GHz). FT-EPR experiments on organic radicals in solution have been performed with the new pulses, designed for uniform excitation over a significantly increased bandwidth compared to a classical rectangular π/2 pulse of the same \{B1\} amplitude. The concept of a dead-time compensated prefocused pulse has been introduced to \{EPR\} with a self-refocusing of 200 ns after the end of the pulse. Echo-like refocused signals have been recorded and compared to the performance of a classical Hahn-echo sequence. The impulse response function of the microwave setup has been measured and incorporated into the algorithm for designing \{OCT\} pulses, resulting in further significant improvements in performance. Experimental limitations and potential new applications of \{OCT\} pulses in \{EPR\} spectroscopy will be discussed.},

  abstract = {\{EPR\} spectra at 250 \{MHz\} for a single crystal of lithium phthalocyanine (LiPc) in the absence of oxygen and for a deoxygenated aqueous solution of a Nycomed triarylmethyl (trityl-CD3) radical were obtained at scan rates between 1.3 × 103 and 3.4 × 105 G/s. These scan rates are rapid relative to the reciprocals of the electron spin relaxation times (LiPc: T1=3.5 μs and T2=2.5 μs; trityl: T1=12 μs and T2=11.5 μs) and cause characteristic oscillations in the direct-detected absorption spectra. For a given scan rate, shorter values of \{T2\} and increased inhomogeneous broadening cause less deep oscillations that damp out more quickly than for longer T2. There is excellent agreement between experimental and calculated lineshapes and signal amplitudes as a function of radiofrequency magnetic field (B1) and scan rate. When \{B1\} is adjusted for maximum signal amplitude as a function of scan rate, signal intensity for constant number of scans is enhanced by up to a factor of three relative to slow scans. The number of scans that can be averaged in a defined period of time is proportional to the scan rate, which further enhances signal amplitude per unit time. Longer relaxation times cause the maximum signal intensity to occur at slower scan rates. These experiments provide the first systematic characterization of direct-detected rapid-scan \{EPR\} signals.},

  abstract = {Spinel-type lithium manganese oxides are considered as promising cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Trace amounts of Li2MnO3 usually occur as a secondary phase in lithium-manganese spinels in the common high-temperature, solid-state synthesis, affecting the overall Li–Mn stoichiometry in the spinel phase and thereby the electrochemical performance. However, the formation of Li2MnO3 lower than 1 wt.\% can hardly be quantified by the conventional analytical techniques. In this work, we synthesized lithium-manganese spinels with different Li/Mn molar ratios and demonstrate that electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) enables quantifying trace amounts of Li2MnO3 below 10−2 wt.\% in the synthesized products. The results reveal that the formation of Li2MnO3 secondary phase is favored by lithium excess in the synthesis. Based on the quantitative evaluation of the EPR data, precise determining Li–Mn stoichiometry in the spinel phase in Li1+xMn2−xO4 materials can be assessed. Accordingly, it is possible to estimate the amount of lithium on 16d-sites in the Li-rich manganese spinels.},

Previously it was shown that the slow-scan lineshape could be recovered from triangular rapid scans by Fourier deconvolution. In this paper a general Fourier deconvolution method is described and demonstrated to recover the slow-scan lineshape from sinusoidal rapid scans. Since an analytical expression for the Fourier transform of the driving function for a sinusoidal scan was not readily apparent, a numerical method was developed to do the deconvolution. The slow scan \{EPR\} lineshapes recovered from rapid triangular and sinusoidal scans are in excellent agreement for lithium phthalocyanine, a trityl radical, and the nitroxyl radical, tempone. The availability of a method to deconvolute sinusoidal rapid scans makes it possible to scan faster than is feasible for triangular scans because of hardware limitations on triangular scans.},

  abstract = {In rapid frequency scan \{EPR\} with triangular scans, sufficient time must be allowed to insure that the magnetization in the x, y plane decays to baseline at the end of the scan, which typically is about 5T2 after the spins are excited. To permit relaxation of signals excited toward the extremes of the scan the total scan time required may be much longer than 5T2. However, with periodic, saw-tooth excitation, the slow-scan \{EPR\} spectrum can be recovered by Fourier deconvolution of data recorded with a total scan period of 5T2, even if some spins are excited later in the scan. This scan time is similar to polyphase excitation methods. The peak power required for either polyphase excitation or rapid frequency scans is substantially smaller than for pulsed EPR. The use of an arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) and cross loop resonator facilitated implementation of the rapid frequency scan experiments reported here. The use of constant continuous low B1, periodic excitation waveform, and constant external magnetic field is similar to polyphase excitation, but could be implemented without the \{AWG\} that is required for polyphase excitation.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a recently developed new family of miniature surface resonators, used for electron spin resonance spectroscopy and imaging. The first part of the paper provides a detailed description of the operational principles of the surface resonators. It also includes sensitivity analysis for a variety of configurations with inner dimensions ranging from 150 μm down to 2 μm, operating at the Ku, Q, and W frequency bands. Most of the data presented here is based on theoretical predictions; however, some of it is accompanied by experiential results for verification. The second part of the paper describes a new type of double-surface microresonator and its production method. This new configuration enables an efficient coupling of the microwave energy from millimetre-sized microstrip lines to micron structures even at relatively low frequencies. The resonator is analysed both theoretically and experimentally – exhibiting ultra-high spin sensitivity. The conclusion of the two parts of the paper is that micron-scale surface microresonators may achieve spin sensitivity of a few thousands of spins in one second of acquisition time for special samples, such as phosphorous-doped 28Si, at cryogenic temperatures. However, further miniaturization below 1–2 microns does not seem to be beneficial, sensitivity-wise. In addition to their high spin sensitivity, these resonators have a huge conversion factor, reaching in some cases to more than 500–1000 G of microwave magnetic field with input power of 1 W. Some possible applications of these unique capabilities are also described herein.},

  abstract = {Recent technological and methodological advances have strongly increased the potential of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) techniques to characterize the structure and dynamics of metalloproteins. These developments include the introduction of powerful pulsed EPR/ENDOR methodologies and the development of spectrometers operating at very high microwave frequencies and high magnetic fields. This overview focuses on how valuable information about metalloprotein structure–function relations can be obtained using a combination of EPR and ENDOR techniques. After an overview of the historical development and a limited theoretical description of some of the key EPR and ENDOR techniques, their potential will be highlighted using selected examples of applications to iron-, nickel-, cobalt-, and copper-containing proteins. We will end with an outlook of future developments.},

  abstract = {The direct detection of free radicals is limited by their extremely short half-life in aqueous solution and this is likely to be even shorter in biological systems. However, this chapter describes how free radicals can be detected in biological systems with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy by the use of small diamagnetic probes, e.g., nitrone-based and hydroxylamines, and paramagnetic probes, e.g., nitroxides and trityl radicals. EPR is a powerful tool able to provide key information on the concentration of reactive species formed, the nature of the radical formed, the kinetics of radical formation, oxygen concentration, and more. This chapter describes the basis of EPR and also the chemistry and classification of spin trapping, the analytical technique used to detect and identify the nature and structure of transient free radicals. The kinetics and thermodynamics of spin trapping and adduct decay, which are the two key properties to be considered in using spin traps for radical detection, are described in detail along with the use of nitrones in the process. The biostability and cytotoxicity of spin traps are also discussed and the various routes for nitrone synthesis are detailed. The chapter also discusses how to interpret the EPR spectra to accurately provide information on the identity, molecular size, and nature of the radical species being trapped as well as their concentration. The chapter concludes with a detailed discussion of the applications of spin trapping and how to overcome challenges posed by the biological milieu and the detection of oxygen species.},

  abstract = {Cutaneous (skin) oxygenation is an important prognostic factor for the treatment of chronic wounds, skin cancer, diabetes side effects, and limb amputation. Currently, there are no reliable methods for measuring this parameter. Oximetry, using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, is emerging as a potential tool for clinical oximetry, including cutaneous applications. The problem with EPR oximetry, however, is that the conventional EPR design requires the use of a large magnet that can generate homogeneous field across the sample, making it unattractive for clinical practice. We present a novel approach that makes use of a miniature permanent magnet, combined with a small microwave resonator, to enable the acquisition of EPR signals from paramagnetic species placed on the skin. The instrumentation consists of a hand-held, modular, cylindrical probehead with overall dimensions of 36-mm diameter and 24-mm height, with 150-g weight. The probehead includes a Halbach array of 16 pieces (4×4×8 mm\textsuperscript{3}) of Sm-Co permanent magnet and a loop-gap resonator (2.24 GHz). Preliminary measurements using a Hahn-echo pulse sequence (800 echos in 20 ms) showed a signalto- noise ratio of \textasciitilde 70 compared to \textasciitilde 435 in a homogenous magnet under identical settings. Further work is in progress to improve the performance of the probehead and to optimize the hand-held system for clinical use},

  abstract = {Electron spin resonance (ESR) is a powerful analytical technique used for the detection, quantification, and characterization of paramagnetic species ranging from stable organic free radicals and defects in crystals to gaseous oxygen. Traditionally, ESR requires the use of complex instrumentation, including a large magnet and a microwave resonator in which the sample is placed. Here, we present an alternative to the existing approach by inverting the typical measurement topology, namely placing the ESR magnet and resonator inside the sample rather than the other way around. This new development relies on a novel self-contained ESR sensor with a diameter of just 2 mm and length of 3.6 mm, which includes both a small permanent magnet assembly and a tiny (∼1 mm in size) resonator for spin excitation and detection at a frequency of ∼2.6 GHz. The spin sensitivity of the sensor has been measured to be ∼1011 spins/√Hz, and its concentration sensitivity is ∼0.1 mM, using reference samples with a measured volume of just ∼10 nL. Our new approach can be applied for monitoring the partial pressure of oxygen in vitro and in vivo through its paramagnetic interaction with another stable radical, as well as for simple online quantitative inspection of free radicals generated in reaction vessels and electrochemical cells via chemical processes.},
